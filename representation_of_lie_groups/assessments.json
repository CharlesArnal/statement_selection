So this is \u22650, and if it is zero then either b = 0, in which case \u03c6 = \u03c8 and there is nothing to prove, or a = 0, so s\u03b1\u03bb = \u03bb and s\u03b1 \u2208W\u03bb, as claimed. 116 Now let us consider the general case. By assumption, there is a chain \u03c8 = \u03c8m <\u03b1m \u03c8m\u22121... <\u03b11 \u03c80 = \u03c6, where \u03b11, ..., \u03b1m are positive roots of R. Thus, as we\u2019ve shown, (\u03bb \u2212\u03c8i)2 \u2264(\u03bb \u2212\u03c8i\u22121)2 for all i \u22651, so (\u03bb \u2212\u03c6)2 \u2264(\u03bb \u2212\u03c8)2. Moreover, if (\u03bb \u2212\u03c6)2 = (\u03bb \u2212\u03c8)2 then (\u03bb \u2212\u03c8i\u22121)2 = (\u03bb \u2212\u03c8i)2 for all i \u22651 so \u03c8i\u22121 \u2208W\u03bb\u03c8i, hence \u03c8 \u2208W\u03bb\u03c6.",
