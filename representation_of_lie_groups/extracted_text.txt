Introduction
These notes are based on the course “Representations of Lie groups”
taught by the author at MIT in Fall 2021 and Fall 2023. This is the
third semester of Lie theory, which follows the standard 2-semester
introductory sequence, “Lie groups and Lie algebras I, II” (for the
author’s notes of these courses, see [E]). The notes cover the basic
theory of representations of non-compact semisimple Lie groups, with
a more in-depth study of (non-holomorphic) representations of complex
groups.
Representation theory of (non-compact) semisimple Lie groups is an
important and deep area of Lie theory with numerous applications,
ranging from physics (quantum ﬁeld theory) to analysis (harmonic
analysis on homogeneous spaces) and number theory (the theory of au-
tomorphic forms, Langlands program). It is a synthetic subject which,
besides basic Lie theory and representation theory, uses a plethora of
techniques from many other ﬁelds, notably analysis, commutative and
non-commutative algebra, category theory, homological algebra and
algebraic geometry. For basic Lie theory (in particular, structure and
ﬁnite-dimensional representations of compact Lie groups and semisim-
ple complex Lie algebras) we will rely on the notes [E]. In other areas,
most of the time we review the necessary material before using it, but
at least a superﬁcial previous familiarity with these subjects will be
helpful to the reader.
Representation theory of semisimple Lie groups originated in the
work of Bargmann [Ba] and Gelfand-Naimark [GN] in the late 1940s in
the case of SL2 and was systematically developed by Harish-Chandra
in 1950s and 1960s, and later developed by many prominent mathe-
maticians, notably R. Langlands, who classiﬁed the irreducible repre-
sentations ([La]). A new conceptual approach to the representation
theory of complex semisimple Lie groups was proposed by J. Bernstein
and S. Gelfand around 1980 ([BG]) based on their previous pioneering
work with I. Gelfand on category O. This ultimately made the rep-
resentation theory of semisimple Lie groups a part of the new subject
of geometric representation theory that emerged in early 1980s from
the Kazhdan-Lusztig conjecture on multiplicities in category O and
its proof using geometric methods (D-modules and perverse sheaves)
by Beilinson-Bernstein and Brylinski-Kashiwara. Since that time the
theory has made giant strides forward (for example, computation of
irreducible characters of real reductive groups by G. Lusztig and D.
Vogan in 1980s, now implemented in the computer package ATLAS,
5

[PAGE 6]
as well as progress in the classiﬁcation of unitary representations de-
scribed in [ALTV]), and the connection with geometry has remained
the main driving force of its development all along.
The organization of the notes is as follows. In Sections 1-7 we discuss
the analytic aspects of the theory, arising from the fact that interest-
ing representations of non-compact Lie groups are inﬁnite-dimensional
and realized in topological vector spaces. We introduce the main ana-
lytic tools, such as Fr´echet spaces, the convolution algebra of measures
on the group, K-ﬁnite, smooth and analytic vectors, matrix coeﬃ-
cients, and then discuss theorems of Harish-Chandra which allow one
to reduce the study of representations of a semisimple Lie group G to
the study of admissible (g, K)-modules, where g = LieG and K is a
maximal compact subgroup of G, and thereby to the purely algebraic
problem of studying Harish-Chandra modules. Then in Section 8 we
recall the theory of highest weight modules for g, and in Section 9
use the developed theory to classify irreducible and unitary irreducible
representations of SL2(R).
The rest of the notes is almost completely algebraic. Namely, in Sec-
tions 10-14, we prove a number of fundamental properties of the action
of the Weyl group W on the symmetric algebra Sh on the Cartan sub-
algebra h and of the universal enveloping algebra U(g) for a semisimple
complex Lie algebra g – the Chevalley restriction theorem, Chevalley-
Shephard-Todd theorems ([Che],[ST]), Kostant theorems ([Ko]). Then
in Sections 15, 16 we develop the basic theory of the BGG category
O, and in Section 17 discuss the nilpotent cone of g, proving that
it is a reduced irreducible variety.
In Sections 18, 19 we prove the
Duﬂo-Joseph theorem and discuss principal series representations of
the complex Lie group G. Here we also introduce a functor Hλ which
connects category O with the category Harish-Chandra bimodules for
g. In Sections 20, 21 we continue to study category O (BGG theorem,
BGG reciprocity, multiplicities, formulation of the Kazhdan-Lusztig
conjectures). In Sections 22-25 we give an exposition of the the theory
of projective functors of J. Bernstein and S. Gelfand ([BG]) and give
its applications to representation theory of complex groups (classiﬁca-
tion of irreducible representations, describing the category of Harish-
Chandra bimodules in terms of category O) as well as to the structure
theory of U(g) (Duﬂo’s theorem on primitive ideals). In Section 26,
we apply these results to the group G = SL2(C) and give an explicit
classiﬁcation of its irreducible and unitary irreducible representations.
Finally, in Sections 27-31 we outline the geometric approach to rep-
resentation theory of semisimple Lie groups, starting from Borel-Weil
theorem and then proceeding to D-modules, the Beilinson-Bernstein

localization theorem, and classiﬁcation of irreducible Harish-Chandra
modules by data attached to K-orbits on G/B. In these sections the
material is more advanced and the exposition is less detailed.
The notes are divided into 31 sections which roughly correspond to
80 minute lectures. So there is a bit more material than in a 1-semester
course (which normally consists of 26 lectures). So if these notes are
used to teach a course, some material (roughly equivalent to 5 sections)
should be skipped. A lot of important material is included in exercises,
which are often provided with detailed hints and may be assigned as
homework.
Disclaimer: These notes contain nothing original except mistakes
of the author, and in all sections the exposition is mostly adopted from
various existing sources – original articles, textbooks and lecture notes.
For example, the exposition in Sections 1-7 is mostly borrowed from
[G] and [L], in Sections 20, 21 parts are adopted from [Hu], in Sections
22-25 we closely follow [BG], and in Sections 28-30 we follow [BCEY].
Since the material is standard, we do not always give a reference.
Also, these notes only scratch the surface in the deep subject of
representations of semisimple Lie groups. For a more in-depth study
of this theory, we recommend the books [K], [ABV] and the lectures
[KT]; for recent progress on unitary representations see [ALTV]. For
more about category O we refer the reader to [Bez], [Hu]. For more
on the theory of D-modules and their applications to representation
theory we recommend the book [HTT].

1. Continuous representations of topological groups
This course will be about representations of Lie groups, with a fo-
cus on non-compact groups. While irreducible representations of com-
pact groups are all ﬁnite-dimensional, this is not so for non-compact
groups, whose most interesting irreducible representations are inﬁnite-
dimensional.
Thus to have a sensible representation theory of non-
compact Lie groups, we need to consider their continuous represen-
tations on topological vector spaces.
1.1. Topological vector spaces. All representations we’ll consider
will be over the ﬁeld C, which is equipped with its usual topology.
Recall that a topological vector space over C is a complex vector
space V with a topology in which addition V × V →V and scalar
multiplication C × V →V are continuous.
The topological vector
spaces V we’ll consider will always be assumed to have the following
properties:
• Hausdorﬀ: any two distinct points of V have disjoint neighbor-
hoods.
• locally convex: 0 ∈V (hence every point) has a base of convex
neighborhoods.1 Equivalently, the topology on V is deﬁned by a family
of seminorms2 {να, α ∈A}: a base of neighborhoods of 0 is formed by
ﬁnite intersections of the sets Uα,ε := {v ∈V |να(v) < ε}, α ∈A, ε > 0.
I.e., it is the weakest of the topologies in which all να are continuous.
• sequentially complete: every Cauchy sequence3 is convergent.
Also, unless speciﬁed otherwise, we will assume that V is
• ﬁrst countable: 0 ∈V (equivalently, every point of V ) has
a countable base of neighborhoods. By the Birkhoﬀ-Kakutani theo-
rem, this is equivalent to V being metrizable (topology deﬁned by a
metric), and moreover this metric can be chosen translation invariant:
d(x, y) = D(x −y) for some function D : V →R≥0.
In this case V is called a Fr´echet space. For example, every Ba-
nach space (a complete normed space), in particular, Hilbert space
is a Fr´echet space.
Recall that a Hausdorﬀtopological vector space V is said to be
complete if whenever V is realized as a dense subspace of a Hausdorﬀ
1Recall that a set X ⊂V is convex if for any x, y ∈X and t ∈[0, 1] we have
tx + (1 −t)y ∈X.
2Recall that a seminorm on V is a function ν : V →R≥0 such that ν(x + y) ≤
ν(x) + ν(y) and ν(λx) = |λ|ν(x) for x, y ∈V , λ ∈C. A seminorm is a norm iﬀ
ν(x) = 0 implies x = 0.
3Recall that a sequence an ∈V is Cauchy if for any neighborhood U of 0 ∈V
there exists N such that for n, m ≥N we have an −am ∈U.
8

[PAGE 9]
topological vector space V with induced topology, we have V = V .
Every complete space is sequentially complete, and the converse holds
for metrizable spaces (albeit not in general). Thus a Fr´echet space can
be deﬁned as a locally convex complete metrizable topological vector
space.
Alternatively, a Fr´echet space may be deﬁned as a complete topo-
logical vector space with topology deﬁned by a countable system of
seminorms νn : V →R, n ≥1. Thus, a sequence xm ∈V goes to
zero iﬀνn(xm) goes to zero for all n. Note that the Hausdorﬀprop-
erty is then equivalent to the requirement that any vector x ∈V with
νn(x) = 0 for all n is zero.
A translation-invariant metric on a Fr´echet space may be deﬁned by
the formula
d(x, y) = D(x −y), D(x) :=
∞
X
n=1
1
2n
νn(x)
1 + νn(x).
Note however that D is not a norm, as it is not homogeneous: for
λ ∈C, D(λx) ̸= |λ|D(x). If we had a ﬁnite collection of seminorms,
we could deﬁne a norm simply by D(x) := P
n νn(x), but if there are
inﬁnitely many, this sum may not converge, and we have to sacriﬁce
the homogeneity property for convergence. In fact, the examples below
show that there are important Fr´echet spaces that are not Banach (i.e.,
do not admit a single norm deﬁning the topology). We also note that
the same Fr´echet space structure on V can be deﬁned by diﬀerent
systems of seminorms νn, and there is also nothing canonical about the
formula for D (e.g., we can replace
1
2n by any sequence an > 0 with
P
n an < ∞), so νn or D are not part of the data of a Fr´echet space.
Finally, unless speciﬁed otherwise, we will assume that V is
• second countable: admits a countable base.
For metrizable
spaces, this is equivalent to being separable (having a dense countable
subset).
Example 1.1. 1. Let X be a locally compact second countable Haus-
dorﬀtopological space (e.g., a manifold). Then it is easy to see that
X can be represented as a countable nested union of compact subsets:
X = S
n≥1 Kn, K1 ⊂K2 ⊂.... Let C(X) be the space of continuous
complex-valued functions on X. We can then deﬁne seminorms νn by
νn(f) = max
x∈Kn |f(x)|.
(this is well deﬁned since Kn are compact). This makes C(X) into a
Fr´echet space, and this structure is independent on the choice of the
9

[PAGE 10]
sequence Kn.
The convergence in C(X) is uniform convergence on
compact sets.
By the Tietze extension theorem, if K ⊂L are compact Haus-
dorﬀspaces then the restriction map C(L) →C(K) is surjective. So
C(X) = limn→∞
←−−−−−C(Kn) as a vector space. Alternatively, without mak-
ing any choices, we may write C(X) = limK⊂X
←−−−−−C(K), where K runs
over compact subsets of X.
2. If X is a manifold and 0 ≤k ≤∞, we can similarly deﬁne a
Fr´echet space structure on the space Ck(X) of k times continuously
diﬀerentiable functions on X. Namely, cover X by countably many
closed balls Kn, each equipped with a local coordinate system, and set
νn,m(f) = max
x∈Kn ∥dmf(x)∥, 0 ≤m ≤k
where dmf(x) is the m-th diﬀerential of f at x, comprising the m-th
mixed partial derivatives of f at x with respect to the local coordinates
(these are labeled by two indices rather than one, but it does not matter
since this collection is still countable). The convergence in Ck(X) is
uniform convergence with all derivatives up to k-th order on compact
sets.
These spaces are not Banach unless X is compact. Moreover, C∞(X)
is not Banach even for compact X (of positive dimension). For exam-
ple, for C∞(S1) we may take,
νm(f) =
m
X
i=0
max
x∈S1 |f (i)(x)|,
but this is still an inﬁnite collection. Note that these are all norms,
not just seminorms, but each of them taken separately does not deﬁne
the correct topology on C∞(S1) (namely, νm deﬁnes the incomplete
topology induced by embedding C∞(S1) as a dense subspace into the
Banach space Cm(S1) with norm νm).
3. The Schwartz space S(R) ⊂C∞(R) is the space of functions f
with
νm,n(f) := sup
x∈R
|xn∂mf(x)| < ∞, m, n ≥0.
This system of seminorms can then be used to give S(R) the structure of
a (non-Banach) Fr´echet space. The same deﬁnition can be used for the
Schwartz space S(RN), by taking n = (n1, ..., nN), m = (m1, ..., mN),
x = (x1, ..., xN), ∂= (∂1, ..., ∂N), and
xn :=
Y

It is well known that all these spaces are separable (check it!).
1.2. Continuous representations. Let G be a locally compact topo-
logical group, for example, a Lie group.4
Deﬁnition 1.2. A continuous representation of G is a topological
vector space V with a continuous linear action a : G × V →V .5
In particular, a continuous representation gives a homomorphism
π : G →Aut(V ) from G to the group of continuous automorphisms of
V (i.e., continuous linear maps V →V with continuous inverse).6
Deﬁnition 1.3. A continuous representation is called unitary if V
is a Hilbert space and for all g ∈G, the operator π(g) : V →V is
unitary; in other words, π lands in the unitary group U(V ) ⊂Aut(V ).
Exercise 1.4. Let 1 ≤p < ∞and Lp(R) be the Banach space of
measurable functions f : R →R with
∥f∥p =
Z
R
|f(x)|pdx
 1
p
< ∞
(modulo functions vanishing outside a set of measure zero), with norm
f 7→∥f∥p. The Lie group R acts on Lp(R) by translation.
(i) Show that this is a continuous representation, which is unitary
for p = 2 (use approximation of Lp functions by continuous functions
with compact support).
(ii) Prove the same for the Fr´echet spaces Ck(R) and S(R).
Let G be a locally compact group, for example a Lie group. In this
case G is known to have a unique up to scaling right-invariant Haar
measure dx.
For Lie groups, this measure is easy to construct by
spreading a nonzero element of ∧ng∗, g = Lie(G), n = dim g, over the
group G by right translations. Thus we can deﬁne the Banach space
Lp(G) similarly to the case G = R. It is easy to generalize Exercise
1.4 to show that the translation action of G on Lp(G) and Ck(G) is
continuous, with L2(G) unitary.
4Topological groups will always be assumed Hausdorﬀand second countable.
Important examples of locally compact topological groups include groups G(F),
where F is a local ﬁeld and G is an algebraic group deﬁned over F.
If F is
archimedean (R or C) then G(F) is a real, respectively complex, Lie group. Another
example important in number theory is G(Ak), where k is a global ﬁeld, Ak is its
ring of ad´eles, and G is an algebraic group over k.
5It is easy to see that it suﬃces to check this property at points (1, v) for v ∈V .
6Note that by the open mapping theorem, in a Fr´echet space any invertible
continuous operator has a continuous inverse.
11

[PAGE 12]
Example 1.5. Let X be a manifold with a right action of a Lie group
G. We’d like to say that we have a unitary representation of G on
L2(X) via (gf)(x) = f(xg). But for this purpose we need to ﬁx a G-
invariant measure on X, and such a nonzero measure does not always
exist (e.g., G = SL2(R), X = RP1 = S1).
The way out is to use half-densities on X rather than functions.
Namely, recall that if dim X = m then the canonical line bundle KX :=
∧mT ∗X has structure group R×. Consider the character R× →R>0
given by t 7→|t|s, s ∈R, and denote the associated line bundle |K|s.
This is called the bundle of s-densities on X (in particular, densities
for s = 1 and half-densities for s = 1
2). Thus in local coordinates
s-densities are ordinary functions, but when we change coordinates by
x 7→x′ = x′(x), these functions change as
f = f ′| det(∂x′
∂x )|s.
The beneﬁt of half-densities is that for any half-density f, the ex-
pression |f|2 is naturally a density on X, which canonically deﬁnes a
measure that can be integrated over X. As a result, the space L2(X)
of half-densities f on X with
∥f∥2 =
sZ
X
|f|2 < ∞
is a Hilbert space attached canonically to X (without choosing any
additional structures), and any diﬀeomorphism g : X →X deﬁnes a
unitary operator on L2(X). Thus similarly to Exercise 1.4, L2(X) is a
unitary representation of G. Note that if X has a G-invariant measure,
this is the same as a representation of G on L2-functions on X.
In particular, we see that we have a unitary representation of G × G
on L2(G) by left and right translation even though the right-invariant
Haar measure is not always left-invariant.
If V is ﬁnite-dimensional, Aut(V ) = GL(V ) is just the group of in-
vertible matrices, and the continuity condition for representations of
G is just that the map π : G →Aut(V ) is continuous in the usual
topology. Then it is well known that this map is smooth and is de-
termined by the corresponding Lie algebra map g →End(V ) = gl(V ),
and this correspondence is a bijection if G is simply connected.
In
this way the theory of ﬁnite-dimensional continuous representations of
connected Lie groups is immediately reduced to pure algebra.
On the other hand, for inﬁnite-dimensional representations the situ-
ation is more tricky, as there are several natural topologies on Aut(V ).
12

[PAGE 13]
One of them is the strong topology of End(V ) (continuous endomor-
phisms of V ), in which Tn →T iﬀfor all v ∈V we have Tnv →Tv. It
is clear that if (V, π) is a continuous representation of G then the map
π : G →Aut(V ) is continuous in the strong topology, but the converse
is not true, in general. However, the converse holds for Banach spaces
(in particular, for unitary representations).
Proposition 1.6. If V is a Banach space then a representation (V, π)
of G is continuous if and only if the map π : G →Aut(V ) is continuous
in the strong topology.
Proof. Recall the uniform boundedness principle: If Tn is a se-
quence of bounded operators from a Banach space V to a normed space
and for any v ∈V the sequence Tnv is bounded then the sequence ∥Tn∥
is bounded.
Now assume that π is continuous in the strong topology. Let gn ∈G,
gn →1, and vn →v ∈V . Since G is second countable, our job is to
show that π(gn)vn →v. We know that π(gn)v →v, as π(gn) →1 in
the strong topology. So it suﬃces to show that π(gn)(vn −v) →0. As
vn −v →0, it suﬃces to show that the sequence ∥π(gn)∥is bounded.
But this follows from the uniform boundedness principle.
□
Remark 1.7. 1. Another topology on End(V ) for a Banach space V is
the norm topology, deﬁned by the operator norm. It is stronger than
the strong topology, and a continuous representation π : G →Aut(V )
does not have to be continuous in this topology. For example, the
action of R on L2(R) is not. Indeed, denoting by Ta the operator π(a)
given by (Taf)(x) = f(x+a), we have ∥Ta −1∥= 2 for all a ̸= 0 (show
it!).
2. If dim V = ∞then Aut(V ) is not a topological group with respect
to strong topology (multiplication is not continuous).
1.3. Subrepresentations, irreducible representations.
Deﬁnition 1.8. A subrepresentation of a continuous representa-
tion V of G is a closed G-invariant subspace of V . We say that V is
irreducible if its only subrepresentations are 0 and V .
Example 1.9. The translation representation of R on L2(R) is not irre-
ducible, although this is not completely obvious. To see this, we apply
Fourier transform, which is a unitary automorphism of L2(R). The
Fourier transform maps the operator Ta to the operator of multiplica-
tion by eiax. But it is easy to construct closed subspaces of L2(R) invari-
ant under multiplication by eiax: take any measurable subset X ⊂R
and the subspace L2(X) ⊂L2(R) of functions that essentially vanish
outside X (e.g., one can take X = [0, +∞)).
13

[PAGE 14]
Example 1.10. Here is the most basic example of an irreducible
inﬁnite-dimensional representation of a Lie group. Let G be the Heisen-
berg group, i.e., the group of upper triangular unipotent real 3-by-3
matrices. It can be realized as the Euclidean space R3 (with coordinates
x, y, z being the above-diagonal matrix entries), with multiplication law
(a, b, c)(a′, b′, c′) = (a + a′, b + b′, c + c′ + ab′).
Then we can deﬁne a unitary representation of G on V = L2(R) by
setting π(a, 0, 0) = eiax (multiplication operator) and π(0, b, 0) = Tb
(shift by b).
Exercise 1.11. (i) Show that this gives rise to a well deﬁned unitary
representation of G, and compute π(a, b, c) for general (a, b, c).
(ii) Show that V is irreducible.
Hint. Suppose W ⊂V is a proper subrepresentation, and denote
by P : V →V the orthogonal projector to W. We can write P as an
integral operator with Schwartz kernel7 K(x, y), a distribution on R2.
Show that K is translation invariant, i.e., K(x + a, y + a) = K(x, y),
and deduce K(x, y) = k(x−y) for some distribution k(x) on R.8 Show
that (eiax−1)k(x) = 0 for all a ∈R. Deduce that P is a scalar operator.
Conclude that P = 0, so W = 0.
7Recall that every smooth function φ(x, y) on R2 with compact support deﬁnes
a trace class operator Tφ with kernel φ(y, x), i.e.,
(Tφf)(x) =
Z
R
φ(y, x)f(y)dy.
Then the Schwartz kernel K of a continuous endomorphism A of L2(R) is deﬁned
by the formula (K, φ) = Tr(ATφ) (which is well deﬁned since the operator ATφ is
trace class).
8This means that (K, φ) = (k, eφ), where eφ(x) :=
R
R φ(x + y, y)dy.

2. K-ﬁnite vectors and matrix coeﬃcients
2.1. K-ﬁnite vectors. Let K be a compact topological group. In this
case K has a unique right-invariant Haar measure of volume 1, which
is therefore also left-invariant; we will denote this measure by dg. Thus
if V is a ﬁnite-dimensional (continuous) representation of K and B a
positive deﬁnite Hermitian form on V then the form
B(v, w) :=
Z
K
B(gv, gw)dg
is positive deﬁnite and K-invariant, which implies that V is unitary. If
V is irreducible then by Schur’s lemma this unitary structure is unique
up to scaling.
This implies that ﬁnite-dimensional representations of K are com-
pletely reducible: if W ⊂V is a subrepresentation then V = W ⊕W ⊥,
where W ⊥is the orthogonal complement of W under the Hermitian
form.
Now let V be any continuous representation of K (not necessarily
ﬁnite-dimensional).
Deﬁnition 2.1. A vector v ∈V is K-ﬁnite if it is contained in a ﬁnite-
dimensional subrepresentation of V . The space of K-ﬁnite vectors of
V is denoted by V ﬁn.
Let IrrK be the set of isomorphism classes of irreducible ﬁnite-
dimensional representations of K. We have a natural K-invariant linear
map
ξ : ⊕ρ∈IrrKHom(ρ, V ) ⊗ρ →V ﬁn
(where K acts trivially on Hom(ρ, V )) deﬁned by
ξ(h ⊗u) = h(u).
Lemma 2.2. ξ is an isomorphism.
Proof. To show ξ is injective, assume the contrary, and let eρ be an
irreducible subrepresentation of Kerξ. Then eρ = h ⊗ρ for a suitable
h ∈Hom(ρ, V ), so for any u ∈ρ we have h(u) = ξ(h ⊗u) = 0. Thus
h = 0, a contradiction.
It remains to show that ξ is surjective. For v ∈V ﬁn, let W ⊂V ﬁn be
a ﬁnite-dimensional subrepresentation of V containing v. By complete
reducibility, W is a direct sum of irreducible representations. Thus
it suﬃces to assume that W is irreducible. Let h : W ,→V be the
corresponding inclusion. Then v = h(v) = ξ(h ⊗v).
□
Example 2.3. Let K = S1 = R/2πZ. The irreducible ﬁnite-dimensional
representations of K are the characters ρn(x) = einx for integer n. Let
15

[PAGE 16]
V = L2(S1). Then Hom(ρn, V ) is the space of functions on S1 such
that f(x + a) = einaf(x), which is a 1-dimensional space spanned by
the function einx.
It follows that V ﬁn is the space of trigonometric
polynomials P
n aneinx, where only ﬁnitely many coeﬃcients an ∈C
are nonzero.
2.2. Matrix coeﬃcients. Let us now consider the special case V =
L2(K), and view it as a representation of K × K via
(π(a, b)f)(x) = f(a−1xb).
For every irreducible representation ρ ∈IrrK we have a homomorphism
of representations of K × K:
ξρ : EndCρ = ρ∗⊗ρ →L2(K)
deﬁned by
ξρ(h ⊗v)(g) := h(gv).
This map is nonzero, hence injective (as ρ∗⊗ρ is an irreducible K ×K-
module), and is called the matrix coeﬃcient map, as the right hand
side is a matrix coeﬃcient of the representation ρ. The theorem on
orthogonality of matrix coeﬃcients tells us that the images of ξρ
for diﬀerent ρ are orthogonal, and for A, B ∈EndCρ we have
(ξρ(A), ξρ(B)) = Tr(AB†)
dim ρ ,
where B† is the Hermitian adjoint of B with respect to the unitary
structure on ρ. Thus, choosing orthonormal bases {vρi} in each ρ, we
ﬁnd that the functions
ψρij := (dim ρ)
1
2ξρ(Eij),
where Eij := v∗
ρj ⊗vρi are elementary matrices, form an orthonormal
system in L2(K).
Let us view L2(K) as a representation of K via left translations. Let
ρ ∈IrrK. Then every h ∈ρ deﬁnes a homomorphism of representations
fh : ρ∗→L2(K) which, when viewed as an element of L2(K, ρ), is
given by the formula fh(y) := yh. Conversely, suppose f : ρ →V
is a homomorphism.
Then f can be represented by an L2-function
ef : K →ρ such that for any b ∈K, the function x 7→ef(bx) −b ef(x)
vanishes outside a set Sb ⊂K of measure 0. Let S ⊂K × K be the set
of pairs (b, x) such that x ∈Sb. Then S has measure 0, hence the set
Tx of b ∈K such that (b, x) ∈S (i.e., x ∈Sb) has measure zero almost
everywhere with respect to x. So pick x ∈K such that Tx has measure
zero. For y = bx /∈Txx, we have x /∈Sb, so ef(y) = yx−1 ef(x). Thus
16

[PAGE 17]
f = fh where h = x−1 ef(x). It follows that the assignment h 7→fh is
an isomorphism ρ ∼= Hom(ρ∗, L2(K)). This shows that the map
M
ρ∈IrrK
ξρ :
M
ρ∈IrrK
ρ∗⊗ρ →L2(K)ﬁn
is an isomorphism, where L2(K)ﬁn is the space of K-ﬁnite vectors in
L2(K) under left translations. Thus any K-ﬁnite function under left
(or right) translations is actually K × K-ﬁnite, and we have a natural
orthogonal decomposition
L2(K)ﬁn ∼=
M
ρ∈IrrK
ρ∗⊗ρ.
Moreover, since L2(K) is separable, it follows that IrrK is a countable
set.
2.3. The Peter-Weyl theorem. The following non-trivial theorem
is proved in the basic Lie groups course.
Theorem 2.4. (Peter-Weyl) L2(K)ﬁn is a dense subspace of L2(K).
Hence {ψρij} form an orthonormal basis of L2(K), and we have
L2(K) = b⊕ρ∈IrrKρ∗⊗ρ.
(completed orthogonal direct sum under the Hilbert space norm).
Example 2.5. For K = S1 = R/2πZ the Peter-Weyl theorem says
that the Fourier system {einx} is complete, i.e., a basis of L2(S1).
2.4. Partitions of unity. Let X be a metric space with distance func-
tion d, and C ⊂X a closed subset. For x ∈X deﬁne
d(x, C) := infy∈Cd(x, y)
if C ̸= ∅. This function is continuous, since d(x, C) ≤d(x, y)+d(y, C),
hence |d(x, C)−d(y, C)| ≤d(x, y). Thus the function fC(x) :=
d(x,C)
1+d(x,C)
(deﬁned to be 1 if C = ∅) is continuous on X, takes values in [0, 1],
and fC(x) = 0 iﬀx ∈C. So if {Ui, i ∈N} is a countable open cover
of X then the function P
i∈N 2−ifUc
i is continuous and strictly positive,
so we may deﬁne the continuous functions on X
φi :=
2−ifUc
i
P
i∈N 2−ifUc
i
, i ∈N
These functions form a partition of unity subordinate to the cover
{Ui, i ∈N}: each φi is non-negative, vanishes outside Ui, and P
i∈N φi =
1 (a uniformly convergent series on X).

3. Algebras of measures on locally compact groups
3.1. The space of measures. Let X be a locally compact second
countable Hausdorﬀtopological space. It is well known that such a
space is metrizable, so let us ﬁx a metric d deﬁning the topology on X.
As we have seen in Example 1.1, the space C(X) of continuous func-
tions on X is a separable Fr´echet space. So let us consider the topo-
logical dual space, C(X)∗, of continuous linear functionals on C(X).
This space is denoted by Measc(X); its elements are called (complex-
valued) compactly supported (Radon) measures on X. We will
often use the standard notation from measure theory: for f ∈C(X)
and µ ∈Measc(X),
µ(f) =
Z
X
f(x)dµ(x).
We equip Measc(X) with the weak topology,9 in which µn →µ iﬀ
µn(f) →µ(f) for any f ∈C(X) (this topology is commonly called the
weak* topology, but we will drop the *). Namely, the weak topology is
deﬁned by the family of seminorms µ 7→|µ(f)|, f ∈C(X), so Measc(X)
is Hausdorﬀand locally convex. We will also see that Measc(X) is
separable and sequentially complete, but, as shown by the example
below, in general it is not ﬁrst countable (so in particular not second
countable or metrizable), nor complete, so it is not a Fr´echet space.
Example 3.1. Let X = N with discrete topology. Then C(X) is the
space of complex sequences a = {an, n ∈N} with topology deﬁned by
the seminorms νn(a) := |an|, n ∈N (i.e., topology of termwise conver-
gence). So C(X)∗= Measc(X) is the space of eventually vanishing com-
plex sequences f = {fn, n ∈N} (acting on C(X) by f(a) = P
n∈N fnan)
with topology having base of neighborhoods of zero consisting of ﬁnite
intersections of the sets Ua,ε = {f ∈C(X)∗: |f(a)| < ε}, a ∈C(X),
ε > 0. This space has a basis {em, m ≥0} given by (em)n := δmn, i.e.,
it is countable-dimensional.
We have fn →0 in C(X)∗iﬀall fn are supported on some ﬁnite
set S ⊂N and for all j ∈S, fnj →0.
This implies that C(X)∗
is not ﬁrst countable (hence all the more not second countable and
not metrizable). Indeed if Wm, m ≥1 were a basis of neighborhoods
of zero then by replacing Wm by W1 ∩... ∩Wm we can ensure that
W1 ⊃W2 ⊃.... Assuming this is the case, pick Nm ≥1 such that the
sequence am := em
Nm belongs to Wm (it exists since for each m, em
N →0 in
9If X is compact then C(X) is a Banach space and thus so is Measc(X), in the
corresponding norm topology. However, this norm topology is stronger than the
weak topology and is not relevant here.
18

[PAGE 19]
C(X)∗as N →∞). Then the sequence {am, m ≥1} does not converge
to 0, and yet for each m, aj ∈Wm for all j ≥m, contradiction.
Also C(X)∗is not complete, as it is a dense subspace of the space
C(X)∗
alg of all (not necessarily continuous) linear functionals on C(X)
(uncountable-dimensional, hence bigger than C(X)∗), from which it
inherits the weak topology. On the other hand, it is sequentially com-
plete. Indeed, if {fn} is a Cauchy sequence in C(X)∗then fn −fn+1
goes to 0 as n →∞, so for some N and n ≥N, fn −fn+1 is supported
on some ﬁnite set S ⊂N. Hence for all n, fn is supported on the union
of S and the supports of fi, 1 ≤i ≤N, which is a ﬁnite set. Hence it
converges (as it is Cauchy). Also, the countable set C(X)∗
rat of even-
tually vanishing sequences of Gaussian rationals is dense in C(X)∗, so
C(X)∗is separable.
Thus we see that C(X)∗= S
i≥1 C(Ki)∗as a vector space, or, with-
out making any choices, C(X)∗= limK⊂X
−−−−−→C(K)∗, where K runs over
compact subsets of X.
Pick a representation of X as a nested union of compact subsets
Ki, i ≥1. We claim that for any µ ∈C(X)∗there exists i such that
if f ∈C(X) satisﬁes f|Ki = 0 then µ(f) = 0. Indeed, if not then
for each i there is fi ∈C(X) with fi|Ki = 0 but µ(fi) = 1. Then
the series P
i fi converges in C(X) (as it terminates on each Ki, and
every compact subset of X is contained in some Ki) while the series
µ(P
i fi) = P
i µ(fi) = P
i 1 diverges, a contradiction. Thus we see
that C(X)∗= S
i≥1 C(Ki)∗as a vector space, or, without making any
choices, C(X)∗= limK⊂X
−−−−−→C(K)∗, where K runs over compact subsets
of X.
Lemma 3.2. (i) If a sequence {µn, n ≥1} ∈C(X)∗is Cauchy then
there is a compact subset K ⊂X such that µn ∈C(K)∗⊂C(X)∗for
all n.
(ii) C(X)∗is sequentially complete.
Proof. (i) Otherwise for each j ≥1 there exists the largest positive
integer Nj ≥0 such that if f ∈C(X) and f|Kj = 0 then µ1(f) = ... =
µNj−1(f) = 0. The numbers Nj form a nondecreasing sequence, and
since C(X)∗= S
i≥1 C(Ki)∗, we have Nj →∞. So let p(j) ≥j be the
largest i for which Ni = Nj. By assumption, for every j ≥1 there is
fj ∈C(X) with fi|Kj = 0 and µNj(fj) ̸= 0. Then we can arrange that
µNj(f1 + ... + fj) = j, and µNj(fi) = 0 if i > p(j). Now, the series
f := P
i≥1 fi converges in C(X), and we have
µNj(f) = µNj(f1 + ... + fp(j)) = µNp(j)(f1 + ... + fp(j)) = p(j).
19

[PAGE 20]
On the other hand, since µn is Cauchy, we get
p(j + 1) −p(j) = µNj+1(f) −µNj(f) →0, j →∞,
a contradiction since p(j) ≥j.
(ii) Let {µn, n ≥1} be a Cauchy sequence in C(X)∗. By (i), µn ∈
C(K)∗for some compact K ⊂X, so we may assume that X is compact.
Since µn is Cauchy, so is µn(f) for any f ∈C(X). Thus µn weakly
converges to some linear functional µ : C(X) →C given by µ(f) :=
limn→∞µn(f), and our job is to show, that µ is continuous.
Since
µn(f) is convergent, it is bounded, so by the uniform boundedness
principle, the sequence ∥µn∥is bounded above by some constant C,
i.e., |µn(f)| ≤C ∥f∥.
But then |µ(f)| ≤C ∥f∥, so ∥µ∥≤C, as
desired.
□
3.2. Support of a measure. Deﬁne the support of µ ∈C(X)∗, de-
noted suppµ, to be the set of all x ∈X such that for any neighborhood
U of x in X there exists f ∈C(X) vanishing outside U with µ(f) ̸= 0.
Thus the complement (suppµ)c is the set of x ∈X which admit a
neighborhood U such that for every f ∈C(X) vanishing outside U we
have µ(f) = 0. In this case, U ⊂(suppµ)c, so (suppµ)c is open, hence
suppµ is closed. Moreover, since C(X)∗= limK⊂X
−−−−−→C(K)∗, suppµ is
contained in some compact subset K ⊂X, so it is itself compact.
Proposition 3.3. If f ∈C(X) and f|suppµ = 0 then µ(f) = 0.
Proof. For every z ∈(suppµ)c there is a neighborhood Uz ⊂(suppµ)c
such that for any φ ∈C(X) vanishing outside Uz, µ(φ) = 0. These
neighborhoods form an open cover of (suppµ)c. Since (suppµ)c is sec-
ond countable, this cover has a countable subcover {Ui, i ∈N}. Let
{φi, i ∈N} be a continuous partition of unity subordinate to this cover.
Then µ(φif) = 0 for all i, so µ(f) = µ(P
i φif) = P
i µ(φif) = 0, as
claimed.
□
3.3. Finitely supported measures. A basic example of an element
of Measc(X) is a Dirac measure δa, a ∈X, such that δa(f) = f(a).
Thus if an →a in X as n →∞then δan →δa in the weak topology.
A ﬁnite linear combination of Dirac measures is called a ﬁnitely sup-
ported measure, since such measures are exactly the measures with
ﬁnite support. The subspace of ﬁnitely supported measures is denoted
Meas0
c(X).
Lemma 3.4. Meas0
c(X) is a sequentially dense (in particular, dense)
subspace in Measc(X), i.e., every element µ ∈Measc(X) is the limit of
a sequence µn ∈Meas0
c(X) in the weak topology.
20

[PAGE 21]
Proof. By replacing X with suppµ, we may assume that X is compact.
For every n ≥1, let Xn be a ﬁnite subset of X such that the open balls
B(x, 1
n) around x ∈Xn cover X. Let {φnx, x ∈Xn} be a continuous
partition of unity subordinate to this cover, and let
µn :=
X
x∈Xn
µ(φnx)δx ∈Meas0
c(X).
We claim that µn →µ in the weak topology.
Indeed, let f ∈C(X). Then
|µn(f)−µ(f)| = |µ(
X
x∈Xn
φnx(f−f(x))| ≤∥µ∥sup
y∈X
X
x∈Xn
φnx(y)|f(y)−f(x)|.
But f is uniformly continuous, so for every ε > 0 there is N such
that if d(x, y) <
1
N then |f(x) −f(y)| < ε. So for n ≥N, whenever
φnx(y) ̸= 0, we have |f(y) −f(x)| < ε. Thus we get
|µn(f) −µ(f)| ≤ε ∥µ∥sup
y∈X
X
x∈Xn
φnx(y) = ε ∥µ∥,
which implies the desired statement.
□
Note that since X is separable, so is Meas0
c(X) (given a countable
dense subset T ⊂X, ﬁnitely supported measures with support in T
and Gaussian rational coeﬃcients form a countable, sequentially dense
subset ET ⊂Meas0
c(X)). Thus we get that Measc(X) is separable;
moreover, since ET is sequentially dense in Measc(X), the latter is
sequentially separable.
Corollary 3.5. If X, Y are locally compact second countable Hausdorﬀ
spaces then the natural bilinear map
⊠: Meas0
c(X) × Meas0
c(Y ) →Measc(X × Y )
uniquely extends to a bilinear map
⊠: Measc(X) × Measc(Y ) →Measc(X × Y )
which is continuous in each variable.
Proof. It is clear that ⊠is continuous in each variable, so the result
follows from the facts that Meas0
c(X) is sequentially dense in Measc(X)
and that Measc(X) is sequentially complete.
□
Remark 3.6. Here is another proof of Corollary 3.5. We may assume
that X, Y are compact. Given µ ∈C(X)∗, ν ∈C(Y )∗, deﬁne a linear
functional µ ⊠ν on C(X) ⊗C(Y ) ⊂C(X × Y ) by
(µ ⊠ν)(f ⊗g) := µ(f)ν(g).
21

[PAGE 22]
We claim that ∥µ ⊠ν∥≤∥µ∥∥ν∥(in fact, the opposite inequality is
obvious, so we have an equality). Thus our job is to show that for
fi ∈C(X), gi ∈C(Y ), 1 ≤i ≤n, we have
|
X
i
µ(fi)ν(gi)| ≤∥µ∥∥ν∥max
x∈X,y∈Y |
X
i
fi(x)gi(y)|
i.e., that
|ν(
X
i
µ(fi)gi)| ≤∥µ∥∥ν∥max
x∈X,y∈Y |
X
i
fi(x)gi(y)|.
To this end, it suﬃces to show that
max
y∈Y |
X
i
µ(fi)gi(y)| ≤∥µ∥max
x∈X,y∈Y |
X
i
fi(x)gi(y)|,
which would follow from the inequality
|
X
i
µ(fi)gi(y)| ≤∥µ∥max
x∈X |
X
i
fi(x)gi(y)|.
for all y ∈Y . But this is just the inequality |µ(Fy)| ≤∥µ∥maxx∈X |Fy(x)|
applied to Fy(x) := P
i gi(y)fi(x).
Now note that by the Stone-Weierstrass theorem, C(X) ⊗C(Y ) is
dense in C(X × Y ), so µ ⊠ν extends continuously to C(X × Y ).
3.4. The algebra of measures on a locally compact group. Now
let G be a locally compact group.
In this case Meas0
c(G) = CG is
the group algebra of G as an abstract group.
Namely, the algebra
structure is given by δxδy = δxy.
This multiplication is continuous
in the weak topology, hence uniquely extends to Measc(G), since the
latter is sequentially complete and Meas0
c(G) is sequentially dense in
Measc(G). Thus Measc(G) is a topological unital associative algebra
with unit δ1. The multiplication in this algebra may be written as
(µ1 ∗µ2)(f) = (µ1 ⊠µ2, ∆(f)) =
Z
G×G
f(xy)dµ1(x)dµ2(y),
where ∆: C(G) →C(G × G) is given by ∆(f)(x, y) := f(xy). This
multiplication is called the convolution product.
Moreover, if dg is a right-invariant Haar measure on G then any com-
pactly supported continuous function (or, more generally, L1-function)
φ on G gives rise to a measure µ = φdg ∈Measc(G). For such measures
µ1 = φ1dg, µ2 = φ2dg we have
(µ1∗µ2)(f) =
Z
G×G
f(xy)φ1(x)φ2(y)dxdy =
Z
G×G
f(z)φ1(zy−1)φ2(y)dzdy.
22

[PAGE 23]
Thus µ1 ∗µ2 = φdg where
φ(z) =
Z
G
φ1(zy−1)φ2(y)dy.
This is called the convolution of functions.
Now let V be a continuous representation of G with the associated
homomorphism π : G →Aut(V ). This map π extends by linearity to
a homomorphism π : CG = Meas0
c(G) →End(V ).
Let us equip CG with weak topology and introduce the corresponding
product topology on CG × V .
Lemma 3.7. The map CG×V →V given by g 7→π(g)v is continuous.
Thus π is continuous in the weak topology of CG and strong topology
of End(V ).
Proof. We need to show that for any seminorm λ (from the family
deﬁning the topology of V ) there exists a neighborhood U of 0 in the
space CG × V such that for (µ, v) ∈U we have λ(π(µ)v) < 1. Let
µ = Pn
i=1 ciδxi, then this inequality takes the form
(1)
n
X
i=1
λ(ciπ(xi)v) < 1.
Since λ is a seminorm, (1) would follow from the inequality
(2)
n
X
i=1
|ci|λ(π(xi)v) < 1.
We deﬁne |µ| = Pn
i=1 |ci|δxi and fv(x) := λ(π(x)v), fv ∈C(X). Then
(2) takes the form
(3)
|µ|(fv) < 1.
Clearly, the map (µ, v) 7→|µ|(fv) is continuous, so we may take U to
be deﬁned by (3).
□
Corollary 3.8. If (V, π) is a continuous representation of G then π
the action G × V →V uniquely extends to a continuous bilinear map
Measc(G) × V →V , which gives rise to a continuous unital algebra
homomorphism
π : Measc(G) →End(V ).
Proof. We need to show that for every v ∈V the map µ 7→π(µ)v
uniquely extends by continuity from Meas0
c(G) to Measc(G). This fol-
lows from Lemmas 3.4 and 3.7 since V is complete.

4. Plancherel formulas, Dirac sequences, smooth vectors
4.1. Plancherel formulas. For a compactly supported L1-function f
on G, for brevity let us denote π(fdg) just by π(f).
Proposition 4.1. (Plancherel’s theorem for compact groups) Let K be
a compact group and f1, f2 ∈L2(K). Then
(f1, f2) =
X
ρ∈IrrK
dim ρ · Tr(πρ(f1)πρ(f2)†)
and this series is absolutely convergent.
Proof. Recall that if ei is an orthonormal basis of a Hilbert space H
and f1, f2 ∈H then
(f1, f2) =
X
i
(f1, ei)(ei, f2)
and this series is absolutely convergent.
The result now follows by
applying this formula to the orthonormal basis provided by the Peter-
Weyl theorem:
ψρij =
p
dim ρ(πρ(g)vρi, vρj),
where {vρi} is an orthonormal basis of ρ.
□
Example 4.2. If K = S1, Plancherel’s theorem reduces to the usual
Parseval equality in Fourier analysis:
(f1, f2) =
X
n∈Z
cn(f1)cn(f2),
where cn(f) are the Fourier coeﬃcients of f.
Proposition 4.3. (Plancherel’s formula) If K is a compact Lie group
and f ∈C∞(K) then
f(1) =
X
ρ∈IrrK
dim ρ · Tr(πρ(f))
and this series is absolutely convergent.
Example 4.4. If K = S1 then this formula says that for f ∈C∞(S1)
f(1) =
X
n∈Z
cn(f),
i.e., the Fourier series of f absolutely converges at 1. Note that for
f ∈C(S1) this is false in general!10
10One can show that for an N-dimensional group, the diﬀerentiability needed
for the Plancherel formula is Ck for k > N/2.

Proof. Consider the integral operator A of convolution with the func-
tion f:
(Aψ)(x) = (f ∗ψ)(x) =
Z
K
f(xy−1)ψ(y)dy.
This operator is trace class, since it has smooth integral kernel F(x, y) =
f(xy−1), and
Tr(A) =
Z
K
F(x, x)dx =
Z
K
f(1)dx = f(1).
On the other hand, A is right-invariant, so it preserves the decompo-
sition of L2(K) into the direct sum of ρ ⊗ρ∗and acts on each such
summand as πρ(f) ⊗1. Thus we also have
Tr(A) =
X
ρ∈IrrK
dim(ρ) · Tr(πρ(f)),
as desired.
□
4.2. Dirac sequences. If G is a locally compact group then multi-
plication by dg deﬁnes an inclusion Cc(G) ,→Measc(G) of compactly
supported continuous functions into compactly supported measures as
a (non-unital) subalgebra. Moreover, if G is a Lie group then we have
a nested sequence of subalgebras Ck
c (G), 0 ≤k ≤∞(compactly sup-
ported Ck-functions).
The following lemma shows that while these
subalgebras are non-unital, they are “almost unital”.
Lemma 4.5. There exists a sequence φn ∈Cc(G) such that φn →δ1
in the weak topology as n →∞. Moreover, if G is a Lie group, we can
choose φn ∈C∞
c (G).
Proof. (sketch) φn can be constructed as a sequence of “hat” functions
supported on a decreasing sequence of balls B1 ⊃B2 ⊃... whose
intersection is 1 ∈G. Such hat functions can be chosen smooth if G is
a Lie group.
□
Such sequences φn are called Dirac sequences.
Corollary 4.6. Cc(G) is sequentially dense in Measc(G).
For Lie
groups, C∞
c (G) is sequentially dense in Measc(G).
Proof. By translating a Dirac sequence, for any g ∈G we can construct
a sequence ψn →δg. This implies that Meas0
c(G) is contained in the
sequential closure of Cc(G) (and of C∞
c (G) in the Lie case). So the
result follows from Lemma 3.4.

4.3. Density of K-ﬁnite vectors.
Corollary 4.7. Let V be a continuous representation of a compact
group K. Then V ﬁn is dense in V .
Proof. Let v ∈V , and φn →δ1 a continuous Dirac sequence, which
exists by Lemma 4.5. Then π(φn)v →v as n →∞. But φn ∈L2(K),
so by the Peter-Weyl theorem, there exists ψn ∈L2(K)ﬁn = ⊕ρρ∗⊗ρ
such that
∥ψn −φn∥2 < 1
n.
Then ψn −φn →0 in L2(K), hence in Measc(K). So by Corollary 3.8,
π(ψn −φn)v →0 as n →∞. It follows that π(ψn)v →v as n →∞.
But π(ψn)v ∈V ﬁn.
□
Corollary 4.8. L2(K)ﬁn ⊂C(K) is a dense subspace. Moreover, if K
is a Lie group then L2(K)ﬁn ⊂Ck(K) is a dense subspace for 0 ≤k ≤
∞.
Proof. The claimed inclusions follow since matrix coeﬃcients of ﬁnite-
dimensional representations of K are continuous, and moreover C∞in
the case of Lie groups. The density then follows from Corollary 4.7.
□
Corollary 4.9. If V is an irreducible continuous representation of K
then V is ﬁnite-dimensional.
Proof. By Corollary 4.7, V ﬁn is dense in V . Hence V ﬁn ̸= 0. Let ρ
be a ﬁnite-dimensional subrepresentation of V ﬁn. Then ρ is a closed
invariant subspace of V . Hence ρ = V .
□
4.4. Smooth vectors. Let G be a Lie group. As we have noted in
Subsection 1.2, any continuous ﬁnite-dimensional representation π :
G →Aut(V ) is automatically smooth and thereby deﬁnes a repre-
sentation π∗: g →End(V ) of the corresponding Lie algebra, which
determines π if G is connected. Moreover, if G is simply connected,
this correspondence is an equivalence of categories. This immediately
reduces the problem to pure algebra and is the main tool of studying
ﬁnite-dimensional representations of Lie groups.
We would like to have a similar theory for inﬁnite-dimensional repre-
sentations. But in the inﬁnite-dimensional setting the above statements
don’t hold in the literal sense.
Example 4.10. Consider the action of S1 on L2(S1). Then the Lie
algebra should act by
d
dθ. But this operator does not act on L2(S1).
The largest subspace of L2(S1) preserved by this operator (acting on
distributions on S1) is C∞(S1).

This motivates the notion of a smooth vector in a continuous rep-
resentation of a Lie group. To deﬁne this notion, for a manifold X and
a topological vector space V , denote by C∞(X, V ) the space of smooth
maps X →V (where smooth maps are deﬁned in the same way as in
the case of ﬁnite-dimensional V ).
Deﬁnition 4.11. Let (V, π) be a continuous representation of a Lie
group G. A vector v ∈V is called smooth if the map G →V given by
g 7→π(g)v is smooth, i.e., belongs to C∞(G, V ). The space of smooth
vectors is denoted by V ∞.
It is clear that V ∞⊂V is a G-invariant subspace (although not a
closed one).
Example 4.12. For the representation of a compact Lie group K on
V = L2(K), we have V ∞= C∞(K).
Proposition 4.13. Let (V, π) be a continuous representation of a Lie
group G with g = Lie(G). Let v ∈V ∞. Then we have a linear map
π∗,v : g →V ∞given by
π∗,v(b) = d
dt|t=0π(etb)v.
This deﬁnes a Lie algebra homomorphism π∗: g →EndC(V ∞) (algebra
of all linear endomorphisms of V ∞) given by π∗(b)v := π∗,v(b).
Exercise 4.14. Prove Proposition 4.13.
Proposition 4.15. (i) V ∞is dense in V .
(ii) V ﬁn ⊂V ∞.
Proof. (i) Let φn →δ1 be a smooth Dirac sequence. Then π(φn)v →v
as n →∞. But it is easy to see that π(φn)v ∈V ∞.
(ii) This follows since matrix coeﬃcients of ﬁnite-dimensional repre-
sentations are smooth.

5. Admissible representations and (g, K)-modules
5.1. Admissible representations. Now let G be a Lie group and
K ⊂G a compact subgroup. For a continuous representation V of G,
denote by V K-ﬁn the space (V |K)ﬁn. In general V K-ﬁn is not contained
in V ∞; for example, if K = 1 then V K-ﬁn = V . However, this inclusion
holds if K is suﬃciently large and V is suﬃciently small.
Deﬁnition 5.1. V is said to be K-admissible (or of ﬁnite K-type)
if for every ﬁnite-dimensional irreducible representation ρ of K, the
space HomK(ρ, V ) is ﬁnite-dimensional.
Example 5.2. Let G be a connected Lie group and V = L2(G/B)
where B is a closed subgroup of G (half-densities on G/B). Then V
is K-admissible iﬀK acts transitively on G/B, i.e., KB = G. In this
case setting T = K ∩B, we have G/B = K/T, so V = L2(K/T) and
HomK(ρ, V ) ∼= (ρT)∗.11
Example 5.3. For G = SL2(C) and K = SU(2), the unitary repre-
sentation of G on the space V = L2(CP1) of square-integrable half-
densities on CP1 is K-admissible. Indeed, taking ρn to be the repre-
sentation of SU(2) with highest weight n, we have dim Hom(ρn, V ) = 0
for odd n and 1 for even n.
More generally, for a real number s we may consider the representa-
tion Vs of square integrable 1
2 +is-densities on CP1; this space is canon-
ically deﬁned since for a 1
2 + is-density f, the complex conjugate f is a
1
2 −is-density, so |f|2 = ff is a density and can be integrated canon-
ically over CP1. This representation has the same K-multiplicities as
V = V0.
Similarly, for G = SL2(R), K = SO(2), we have a unitary K-
admissible representation V = L2(RP1) (half-densities) and more gen-
erally Vs (1
2 + is-densities). For the K-multiplicities we have equalities
dim Hom(χn, Vs) = 1 for odd n and 0 for even n, where χn(θ) = einθ.
We will see that the representations Vs in both cases are irreducible
and Vs, Vt are isomorphic iﬀs = ±t. The family of representations Vs
is called the unitary spherical principal series.
11Note that here we don’t have to distinguish between half-densities and func-
tions on K/T since K/T always has a K-invariant volume form as K is compact.
28

[PAGE 29]
Note that this family makes sense also when s is a complex number
which is not necessarily real. In this case Vs is not necessarily uni-
tary but still a continuous representation on square integrable 1
2 + is-
densities. The space of such densities is canonically deﬁned as a topo-
logical vector space, although its Hilbert norm is not canonically de-
ﬁned unless s is real (however, we will see that for some non-real s,
corresponding to so-called complementary series, this representa-
tion is still unitary, even though the inner product is not given by the
standard formula). The family Vs with arbitrary complex s is called
the spherical principal series.
Explicitly, the action of G on Vs looks as follows (realizing elements
of Vs as functions on R or C, removing the point at inﬁnity):
 
a
b
c
d
−1
f
!
(z) = f
az + b
cz + d

|cz + d|−m(1+2is),
where m = 1 in the real case and m = 2 in the complex case.
Proposition 5.4. If V is K-admissible then V K-ﬁn ⊂V ∞, and it is a
g-submodule (although not in general a G-submodule).
Proof. For a ﬁnite-dimensional irreducible representation ρ of K, let
V ρ := Hom(ρ, V ) ⊗ρ be the isotypic component of ρ.
We claim that for any continuous representation V the space V ∞∩V ρ
is dense in V ρ. Indeed, let ψρ ∈L2(K)ﬁn be the character of ρ given
by
ψρ =
X
i
ψρii.
Let ξρ be the pushforward of ψρdx from K to G (a measure on G sup-
ported on K). Then π(ξρ) is the projector to V ρ annihilating ⊕η̸=ρV η.
Let φn →δ1 be a smooth Dirac sequence on G. Then for v ∈V ρ,
π(ξρ ∗φn)v = π(ξρ)π(φn)v →π(ξρ)v = v
as n →∞. However, ξρ ∗φn is smooth, so π(ξρ ∗φn)v ∈V ∞∩V ρ.
Thus if V ρ is ﬁnite-dimensional (which happens for K-admissible V )
then V ∞∩V ρ = V ρ, so V ρ ⊂V ∞. Hence V K-ﬁn ⊂V ∞.
Finally, it is clear that for b ∈g and v ∈V ρ, the vector bv generates
a K-submodule of a multiple of g ⊗ρ, so bv ∈V K-ﬁn. It follows that
V K-ﬁn is a g-submodule.
□
Example 5.5. If G = SL2(R), K = SO(2), V = Vs = L2(S1) is
a spherical principal series representation, then V K-ﬁn is the space of
trigonometric polynomials. Note that this space is not invariant under
29

[PAGE 30]
the action of G. However, the Lie algebra g = sl2(R) does act on this
space.
Exercise 5.6. Compute this Lie algebra action in the basis vn = einθ
and write it as ﬁrst order diﬀerential operators in the angle θ. (Pick
generators e, h, f in gC so that h acts diagonally in the basis vi).
5.2. (g, K)-modules. This motivates the following deﬁnition. Let K
be a compact connected Lie group and k = LieK. Let g be a ﬁnite-
dimensional real Lie algebra containing k, and suppose the adjoint ac-
tion of k on g integrates to an action of K. In this case we say that
(g, K) is a Harish-Chandra pair.
Deﬁnition 5.7. Let (g, K) be a Harish-Chandra pair.
(i) A (g, K)-module is a vector space M with actions of K and g
such that
• M is a direct sum of ﬁnite-dimensional continuous K-modules;
• the two actions of k on M (coming from the actions of g and K)
coincide.
(ii) Such a module is said to be admissible if for every ρ ∈IrrK we
have dim HomK(ρ, M) < ∞.
(iii) An admissible (g, K)-module which is ﬁnitely generated over
U(g) is called a Harish-Chandra module.
Exercise 5.8. Show that if M is a (g, K)-module then for every g ∈
K, a ∈g, v ∈M we have
gav = Ad(g)(a)gv,
where Ad denotes the K-action on g.
In fact, a (g, K)-module is a purely algebraic object, since ﬁnite-
dimensional K-modules can be described as algebraic representations
of the complex reductive group KC. Moreover, we can represent them
even more algebraically in terms of the action of k. Namely, let us say
that a ﬁnite-dimensional representation of k is integrable to K if it
corresponds to a representation of K (note that this is automatic if K is
simply connected). Then (g, K)-modules are simply g-modules which
are locally integrable to K when restricted to k (i.e., sum of integrable
modules). So if K is simply connected (in which case k is semisimple)
then a (g, K)-module is the same thing as a g-module which is locally
ﬁnite when restricted to k (i.e., sum of ﬁnite-dimensional modules).
Thus (g, K)-modules form an abelian category closed under exten-
sions (and this category can be deﬁned over any algebraically closed
ﬁeld of characteristic zero). The same applies to admissible (g, K)-
modules and to Harish-Chandra modules (the latter is closed under
30

[PAGE 31]
taking kernels of morphisms because the algebra U(g) is Noetherian,
as so is its associated graded Sg by the Hilbert basis theorem).
Example 5.9. Let G be a connected complex semisimple Lie group.
Then its maximal compact subgroup is the compact form K = Gc.
Thus a (g, K)-module is a g-module M which is locally ﬁnite for gc ⊂g,
where gc = LieGc. Note that the action of g here is only real linear.
Thus we may pass to complexiﬁcations: (gc)C = g, gC = g ⊕g, and
g sits inside g ⊕g as the diagonal. Thus a (g, K)-module is simply a
g ⊕g-module which is locally ﬁnite for the diagonal copy of g. This is
the same as a g-bimodule12 with locally ﬁnite adjoint action
ad(b)m := [b, m] = bm −mb.
For example, if I is any two-sided ideal in U(g) then U(g)/I is a (g, K)-
module.
Thus we obtain the following proposition.
Proposition 5.10. If V is a K-admissible continuous representation
of G then V K-ﬁn is an admissible (g, K)-module.
Exercise 5.11. Show that for any continuous representation V of G,
the intersection V ∞∩V K-ﬁn is a (g, K)-module (not necessarily admis-
sible).
Exercise 5.12. Show that if V is an admissible representation of G
and L a ﬁnite-dimensional (continuous) representation of G then V ⊗L
is also admissible. Prove the same statement for (g, K)-modules.
5.3. Harish-Chandra’s admissibility theorem. We will now re-
strict our attention to semisimple Lie groups G.
By this we will
mean a connected linear real Lie group G with semisimple Lie algebra
g. “Linear” means that it has a faithful ﬁnite-dimensional representa-
tion, i.e., is isomorphic to a closed subgroup of GLn(C). In other words,
G is the connected component of the identity in G(R), where G is a
semisimple algebraic group deﬁned over R. Typical examples of such
groups include SLn(R) and SLn(C) (in the latter case G = SLn ×SLn
and the real structure deﬁned by the involution permuting the two
factors).
A fundamental result about the structure of semisimple Lie groups
is
Theorem 5.13. (E. Cartan) Every semisimple Lie group G has a max-
imal compact subgroup K ⊂G which is unique up to conjugation.
12Indeed, every g ⊕g-module M with action (a, b, v) 7→(a, b) ◦v, a, b ∈g, v ∈M
is a g-bimodule with av = (a, 0) ◦v and vb = (0, −b) ◦v, and vice versa.
31

[PAGE 32]
Example 5.14. For G = SLn(R) we have K = SO(n) and for G =
SLn(C) we have G = SU(n).
We will say that a continuous representation V of G is admissible if
it is K-admissible with respect to a maximal compact subgroup K ⊂G
(does not matter which since they are all conjugate).
Theorem 5.15. (Harish-Chandra’s admissibility theorem, [HC2]) Ev-
ery irreducible unitary representation of a semisimple Lie group is ad-
missible.
We will not give a proof (see [HC2],[Ga]).
Remark 5.16. 1. This theorem extends straightforwardly to the more
general case of real reductive Lie groups.
2. Let G = ^
SL2(R) be the universal covering of SL2(R). Then G is
not linear (why?) and so it is not viewed as a semisimple Lie group
according to our deﬁnition. In fact, Harish-Chandra’s theorem does
not hold as stated for this group, since it has no nontrivial compact
subgroups. This happens because when we take the universal cover,
the maximal compact subgroup SO(2) = S1 gets replaced by the non-
compact group R. However, if we take for K the universal cover of
SO(2) (even though it is not compact) then Harish-Chandra’s theorem
extends straightforwardly to this case.
Exercise 5.17. Let M be an admissible (g, K)-module and
M ∨:= ⊕V ∈IrrK(Hom(V, M) ⊗V )∗⊂M ∗
be the restricted dual to M. Show that M ∨has a natural structure of
an admissible (g, K)-module, and (M ∨)∨∼= M.

6. Weakly analytic vectors
6.1. Weakly analytic vectors and Harish-Chandra’s analytic-
ity. Let G be a Lie group and V a continuous representation of G.
Deﬁnition 6.1. A vector v ∈V is called weakly analytic if for each
h ∈V ∗the matrix coeﬃcient h(gv) is a real analytic function of g.
Example 6.2. Let V = L2(S1) and G = S1 act by rotations. So if
v(x) = P
n∈Z vneinx and h(x) = P
n∈Z hne−inx then for g = eiθ we have
h(g(θ)v) =
X
n∈Z
hnvneinθ.
Thus v is a weakly analytic vector iﬀthe sequence hnvn decays expo-
nentially for any ℓ2-sequence {hn}, which is equivalent to saying that
vn decays exponentially, i.e., v(θ) is analytic.
Theorem 6.3. (Harish-Chandra’s analyticity theorem) If V is an ad-
missible representation of a semisimple Lie group G with maximal com-
pact subgroup K then every v ∈V K-ﬁn is a weakly analytic vector.
Theorem 6.3 is proved in the next two subsections.
6.2. Elliptic regularity. The proof of Theorem 6.3 is based on the
analytic elliptic regularity theorem, which is a fundamental result
in analysis (see [Ca]). To state it, let X be a smooth manifold, and
D(X) the algebra of (real) diﬀerential operators on X. This algebra
has a ﬁltration by order: D0(X) = C∞(X) ⊂D1(X) ⊂..., such that
Dn(X) = {D ∈EndCC∞(X) : [D, f] ∈Dn−1(X)∀f ∈C∞(X)}, n ≥1,
and grD(X) = ⊕n≥0Γ(X, SnTX), where Γ takes sections of the vector
bundle. Thus for every diﬀerential operator D on X of order n we have
its symbol σ(D) ∈grnD(X) = Γ(X, SnTX). For every x ∈X, σ(D)x
is thus a homogeneous polynomial of degree n on T ∗
xX.
Deﬁnition 6.4. We say that D is elliptic at x if σ(D)x(p) ̸= 0 for
nonzero p ∈T ∗
xX. We say that D is elliptic (on X) if it is elliptic at
all points x ∈X.
Example 6.5. 1. If dim X = 1 then any diﬀerential operator with
nonvanishing symbol is elliptic.
2. Fix a Riemannian metric on X and let ∆be the corresponding
Laplace operator, ∆f = div(gradf). Then ∆is elliptic.
3. If D is elliptic then for any nonzero polynomial P ∈R[t] the
operator P(D) is elliptic.
33

[PAGE 34]
Note that ellipticity is an open condition, since it is equivalent to
non-vanishing of σ(D)x on the unit sphere in T ∗
xX (under some inner
product). Thus the set of x ∈X on which a given operator D is elliptic
is open in X.
Theorem 6.6. (Elliptic regularity) Suppose D is an elliptic operator
with real analytic coeﬃcients on an open set U ⊂RN, and f(x) is a
smooth solution of the PDE
Df = 0
on U. Then f is real analytic on U.
Corollary 6.7. Let X be a real analytic manifold and D an elliptic
operator on X with analytic coeﬃcients. Then every smooth solution
of the equation Df = 0 on X is actually real analytic.
Remark 6.8. 1. This is, in fact, true much more generally, when f is
a weak (i.e., distributional) solution of the equation Df = 0. Also the
equation Df = 0 can be replaced by a more general inhomogeneous
equation Df = g, where g is analytic.
2.
If D is not elliptic, there is an obvious counterexample: the
equation
∂2f
∂x∂y = 0 on R2 has smooth non-analytic solutions of the form
f(x) + g(y), f, g ∈C∞(R).
Example 6.9. 1. For N = 1 this theorem just says that a solution of
an ODE
f (n)(x) + a1(x)f (n−1)(x) + .... + an(x)f(x) = 0
with real analytic coeﬃcients is itself real analytic, a classical fact about
ODE.
2. Let N = 2 and D = ∆be the Laplace operator on U ⊂R2 with
respect to some Riemannian metric with real analytic coeﬃcients. This
metric deﬁnes a conformal structure with real analytic local complex
coordinate z.
Then every harmonic function f (i.e., one satisfying
∆f = 0) is a real part of a holomorphic function of z, hence is real
analytic, which proves elliptic regularity in this special case.
3. Suppose f, g are Schwartz functions on Rn and D = Q(∂) is an
elliptic operator with constant coeﬃcients, where Q is a real polynomial
(so the leading term of Q is nonvanishing for nonzero vectors). Then
elliptic regularity says that if g is analytic, so is f. This can be easily
proved using Fourier transform. Indeed, for Fourier transforms we get
Q(p) bf(p) = bg(p). Thus bg(p) =
bf(p)
Q(p), so this must be a smooth function.
Note that |Q(p)| →∞as p →∞because Q has non-vanishing leading
34

[PAGE 35]
term. So, since g is analytic, bg decays exponentially at inﬁnity, hence
so does bf. Thus f is analytic.
6.3. Proof of Harish-Chandra’s analyticity Theorem. We are
now ready to prove Theorem 6.3. Let g = LieG and b ∈U(g). Then
we have a linear operator π∗(b) : V ∞→V ∞, which we will write just
as b for short. Moreover, if b ∈U(g)K then it preserves the subspace
V ρ ⊂V ∞for each irreducible representation ρ of K. Therefore, since
all V ρ are ﬁnite-dimensional, for any v ∈V K-ﬁn there exists a nonzero
polynomial P ∈R[t] such that P(b)v = 0 (e.g., we can take P to be
the product of the characteristic polynomial of b on Kv by its complex
conjugate).
Now recall that U(g) can be thought of as the algebra of left-invariant
real diﬀerential operators on G. Let ψh,v(g) := h(gv) be the matrix
coeﬃcient function. We know that this function is smooth, and we
have
(P(b)ψh,v)(g) = h(gP(b)v) = 0.
Thus if b is an elliptic diﬀerential operator on G, it will follow from
Corollary 6.7 that ψh,v is real analytic, as desired.
It remains to ﬁnd b ∈U(g)K which deﬁnes an elliptic operator on
G. For this purpose ﬁx a left-invariant Riemannian metric on G, and
make it K-invariant (under right, or, equivalently, adjoint action) by
averaging over K. Then the Laplace operator ∆corresponding to this
metric is elliptic and given by some element ∆∈U(g)K, so we may
take b = ∆. This proves Theorem 6.3.
Remark 6.10. If G is simple, there exists a unique up to scaling
two-sided invariant metric on G.
This metric, however, is pseudo-
Riemannian rather than Riemannian if G is not compact. Thus the
corresponding Laplace operator is hyperbolic rather than elliptic, so
not suitable for our purposes.
6.4. Applications of weakly analytic vectors.
Corollary 6.11. The action of G on V is completely determined by
the corresponding (g, K)-module V K-ﬁn.
Proof. Since V K-ﬁn is dense in V , it suﬃces to specify gv for v ∈V K-ﬁn.
For this it suﬃces to specify h(gv) for all h ∈V ∗. By Theorem 6.3 and
the analytic continuation principle, this is determined by the deriva-
tives of all orders of h(gv) at g = 1. But these have the form h(bv)
where b ∈U(g), so are determined by bv.
□
Corollary 6.12. Let W ⊂V K-ﬁn be a sub-(g, K)-module. Then the
closure W ⊂V is G-invariant.
35

[PAGE 36]
Proof. Let w ∈W, g ∈G. It suﬃces to show that gw ∈W. If not,
then the space W ′ := W ⊕Cgw is a closed subspace of V containing
W as a subspace of codimension 1. So there exists a unique continuous
linear functional h : W ′ →C such that h(gw) = 1 and h|W = 0. By
the Hahn-Banach theorem, h can be extended to an element of V ∗.
Thus to get a contradiction, it is enough to show that for every h ∈V ∗
that vanishes on W, we have h(gw) = 0. But by Theorem 6.3, this
function is analytic in g. So it suﬃces to check that its derivatives at
g = 1 vanish. But these derivatives are of the form h(bw) for b ∈U(g),
so vanish since bw ∈W.
□
Corollary 6.13. Let V be an admissible representation of G. There
is a bijection between subrepresentations of V and (g, K)-submodules
of V K-ﬁn, given by α : U ⊂V 7→U K-ﬁn.
The inverse is given by
β : W 7→W.
Proof. Since U K-ﬁn is dense in U, we have β ◦α = Id. To show that
α ◦β = Id, we need to show that W
K-ﬁn = W. Clearly W
K-ﬁn contains
W, so we just need to prove the opposite inclusion. Let w ∈W
ρ, then
we have a sequence wn →w, wn ∈W. Now apply the projector ξρ:
w′
n := π(ξρ)wn →π(ξρ)w = w, n →∞,
and w′
n ∈W ρ. Thus w ∈W ρ = W ρ, since W ρ is ﬁnite-dimensional.
Hence W
K-ﬁn = W.
□
Corollary 6.14. If V is irreducible then V K-ﬁn is an irreducible (g, K)-
module, and vice versa.
Corollary 6.15. If V is of ﬁnite length then V K-ﬁn is a Harish-Chandra
module.
Proof. By Corollary 6.13, V K-ﬁn is a ﬁnite length (g, K)-module. But
any ﬁnite length (g, K)-module is ﬁnitely generated over U(g), hence
a Harish-Chandra module.
□
Let Rep G denote the category of admissible representations of G of
ﬁnite length, and HCG the category of Harish-Chandra modules for G.
Thus we obtain
Theorem 6.16. The assignment V 7→V K-ﬁn deﬁnes an exact, faithful
functor Rep G →HCG, which maps irreducibles to irreducibles.

7. Inﬁnitesimal equivalence and globalization
7.1. Inﬁnitesimal equivalence. The functor of Theorem 6.16 is not
full, however, since there exist pairs of non-isomorphic V, W ∈Rep G
such that V K−ﬁn ∼= W K−ﬁn as Harish-Chandra modules. Representa-
tions V, W ∈Rep G such that V K−ﬁn ∼= W K−ﬁn as Harish-Chadra mod-
ules are called inﬁnitesimally equivalent. In other words, inﬁnites-
imally equivalent representations with the same underlying Harish-
Chandra module M diﬀer by what topology we put on M (namely,
the corresponding representation c
M is the completion of M is this
topology). An example of inﬁnitesimally equivalent but non-isomorphic
representations are L2(RP1) and C∞(RP1) as representations of G =
SL2(R) (with G-action on half-densities).
However, we have the following proposition.
Proposition 7.1. Let V, W be two unitary representations in Rep G.
If V K−ﬁn ∼= W K−ﬁn as Harish-Chandra modules, then V ∼= W as uni-
tary representations. In other words, inﬁnitesimally equivalent unitary
representations in Rep G are isomorphic.
Proof. Clearly, it suﬃces to assume that V, W are irreducible. If V
is unitary irreducible then V K−ﬁn has an invariant positive Hermitian
inner product B = BV restricted from V . Moreover, B is the unique
invariant Hermitian inner product on V K−ﬁn up to scaling.13 Indeed, if
B′ is another then pick a nonzero v ∈V K-ﬁn and let λ := B′(v,v)
B(v,v) . Then
B′ −λB has a nonzero kernel, which is a (g, K)-submodule of V K−ﬁn.
This kernel therefore must be the whole V K−ﬁn, so B′ = λB.
Thus if A : V K−ﬁn →W K−ﬁn is an isomorphism then it is an isometry
with respect to BV , BW under suitable normalization of these forms.
Then A extends by continuity to a unitary isomorphism V →W which
commutes with K.
It remains to show that A commutes with G. For v ∈V , w ∈W,
consider the function
fw,v(g) := BW((gA −Ag)v, w) = BW(gAv, w) −BV (gv, A−1w), g ∈G.
Our job is to show that fw,v(g) = 0. It suﬃces to check this when
v ∈V K−ﬁn, as it is dense in V .
In this case by Harish-Chandra’s
analyticity theorem, the function fw,v(g) is analytic on G. Also all its
derivatives at 1 vanish since bA−Ab = 0 for any b ∈U(g). This implies
that fw,v is indeed zero, as desired.
□
13An invariant inner product on a (g, K)-module is one that is invariant under
both g and K, i.e., K-invariant and satisfying the equality B(av, w)+B(v, aw) = 0
for all a ∈g.

7.2. Dixmier’s lemma and inﬁnitesimal character. The following
is an inﬁnite-dimensional analog of Schur’s lemma.
Lemma 7.2. (Dixmier) Let A be a countable-dimensional C-algebra
and M a simple A-module. Then EndA(M) = C. In particular, the
center Z of A acts on M by a character χ : Z →C.
Note that the condition of countable dimension cannot be dropped.
Without it, a counterexample is A = M = C(x) (the ﬁeld of rational
functions in one variable), then EndA(M) = C(x).
Proof. Let D := EndA(M). By the usual Schur lemma, D is a division
algebra. Assume the contrary, that D ̸= C. Then for any x ∈D \C, D
contains the ﬁeld C(x) of rational functions of x (as C has no ﬁnite ﬁeld
extensions). But C(x) has uncountable dimension (contains linearly
independent elements
1
x−a, a ∈C), hence so does D. On the other hand,
let v ∈M be a nonzero vector, then M = Av and the map D →M
given by T 7→Tv is injective. Thus M is countable-dimensional, hence
so is D, contradiction.
□
Now let g be a countable-dimensional complex Lie algebra and M a
simple g-module. By Lemma 7.2, the center Z(g) of U(g) acts on M by
a character, χ : Z(g) →C. This character is called the inﬁnitesimal
character of M.
In particular, for semisimple groups we obtain
Corollary 7.3. (Schur’s lemma for (g, K)-modules) Any endomor-
phism of an irreducible (g, K)-module M is a scalar. Thus the center
Z(g) of U(g) acts on M by a inﬁnitesimal character χ : Z(g) →C.
The character χ is often also called the inﬁnitesimal character of
M.
Exercise 7.4. Show that the action of Z(g) on every admissible (g, K)-
module M is locally ﬁnite.
7.3. Harish-Chandra’s globalization theorem.
Theorem 7.5. (Harish-Chandra’s globalization theorem) Every uni-
tary irreducible Harish-Chandra module M for G uniquely integrates
(=globalizes) to an irreducible admissible unitary representation of G.
Proof. As before, ﬁx a positive deﬁnite K-invariant inner product on
g, and consider the element C+
g := Pdim g
j=1 a2
j ∈U(g), where aj is an
orthonormal basis of g under this inner product. If Cg is the (suitably
normalized) quadratic Casimir of g, then C+
g = Cg + 2Ck, where Ck is
the Casimir of k := LieK corresponding to the restriction of the inner
38

[PAGE 39]
product to k.
If Lν is the highest weight irreducible representation
with highest weight ν then −Ck|Lν = |ν +ρK|2 −|ρK|2, where ρK is the
half-sum of positive roots of K. Also Cg|M = CM is a scalar. Thus if
M ν := M Lν then
−C+
g |Mν = 2|ν + ρK|2 −2|ρK|2 −CM =: q(ν).
Note that for v ∈M ν we have
dim g
X
j=1
∥ajv∥2 = −(
dim g
X
j=0
a2
jv, v) = −(C+
g v, v) = q(ν) ∥v∥2 ;
in particular, q(ν) ≥0 and q(ν) ∼2|ν|2 for large ν. It follows that for
any a ∈g, v ∈M ν,
∥av∥2 ≤q(ν) ∥a∥2 ∥v∥2 .
Now, for a ∈M ν0 all components of anv belong to M ν, where ν =
ν0 + β1 + ... + βn and βj are weights of g as a K-module. So there exist
R, c = c(ν0) > 0 such that
∥anv∥≤(Rn + c) ∥a∥
an−1v
 , n ≥1.
Thus
∥anv∥≤(R + c)...(Rn + c) ∥a∥n ∥v∥.
So the series
eav :=
X
n≥0
anv
n!
converges absolutely in the Hilbert space c
M in the region ∥a∥< R−1,
and convergence is uniform on compact sets with all derivatives, and
deﬁnes an analytic function of a. Moreover, it is easy to check that
∥eav∥= ∥v∥(since a is skew-symmetric under the inner product of
M). Thus the operator ea : M →c
M extends to a unitary operator
on c
M. The formal Campbell-Hausdorﬀformula then implies that this
deﬁnes a continuous unitary action π of a neighborhood U of 0 in G
on c
M such that π(xy) = π(x)π(y) if x, y, xy ∈U. It is well known that
this implies that π extends to a unitary representation of the universal
cover eG of G on M. Now let eK be the preimage of K in eG (by the polar
decomposition, it is also the universal cover of K). Since by deﬁnition
π| e
K extends to K, it follows that π actually factors through G.
□
Thus, using Harish-Chandra’s admissibility theorem, we obtain
Corollary 7.6. For a semisimple Lie group G, the assignment V 7→
V K−ﬁn is an equivalence of categories between unitary representations
of G of ﬁnite length and unitary Harish-Chandra modules of ﬁnite
39

[PAGE 40]
length (i.e., Harish-Chandra modules which admit an invariant posi-
tive Hermitian inner product).
However, while irreducible Harish-Chandra modules for any G have
been classiﬁed, determining which of them are unitary is a very diﬃcult
problem which is not yet fully solved.

8. Highest weight modules and Verma modules
8.1. g-modules with a weight decomposition. Let us recall basic
results on highest weight modules and Verma modules for a complex
semisimple Lie algebra g.
Let g = n−⊕h ⊕n+ be a triangular decomposition and λ ∈h∗be
a weight. We have n± = ⊕α∈R±gα, where R± are the sets of positive
and negative roots. Let Q ⊂h∗be the root lattice of g spanned by its
roots. Let ei, fi, hi, i = 1, ..., r be the Chevalley generators of g. Let
P ⊂h∗be the weight lattice, consisting of λ ∈h∗with λ(hi) ∈Z for
all i and P+ ⊂P be the set of dominant integral weights, deﬁned by
the condition λ(hi) ∈Z≥0 for all i. Finally, let Q+ ⊂Q be the set of
sums of positive roots.
Deﬁnition 8.1. Let V a representation of g (possibly inﬁnite-dimensional).
Then a vector v ∈V is said to have weight λ if hv = λ(h)v for all
h ∈h. The subspace of such vectors is denoted by V [λ]. If V [λ] ̸= 0,
we say that λ is a weight of V , and the set of weights of V is denoted
by P(V ).
It is easy to see that gαV [λ] ⊂V [λ + α].
Let V ′ ⊂V be the span of all weight vectors in V . Then it is clear
that V ′ = ⊕λ∈h∗V [λ].
Deﬁnition 8.2. We say that V has a weight decomposition (with
respect to a Cartan subalgebra h ⊂g), or is h-semisimple if V ′ = V ,
i.e., if V = ⊕λ∈h∗V [λ].
Note that not every representation of g has a weight decomposition
(e.g., for V = U(g) with g acting by left multiplication all weight
subspaces are zero).
Deﬁnition 8.3. A vector v in V [λ] is called a singular (or highest
weight) vector of weight λ if eiv = 0 for all i, i.e., if n+v = 0.
A representation V of g is a highest weight representation with
highest weight λ if it is generated by such a nonzero vector.
8.2. Verma modules. The Verma module Mλ is deﬁned as “the
largest highest weight module with highest weight λ”. Namely, it is
generated by a single highest weight vector vλ with deﬁning relations
hv = λ(h)v for h ∈h and eiv = 0. More formally, we make the following
deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 8.4. Let Iλ ∈U(g) be the left ideal generated by the
elements h−λ(h), h ∈h and ei, i = 1, ..., r. Then the Verma module
Mλ is the quotient U(g)/Iλ.
41

[PAGE 42]
In this realization, the highest weight vector vλ is just the class of
the unit 1 of U(g).
Proposition 8.5. The map φ : U(n−) →Mλ given by φ(x) = xvλ is
an isomorphism of left U(n−)-modules.
Proof. By the PBW theorem, the multiplication map
ξ : U(n−) ⊗U(h ⊕n+) →U(g)
is a linear isomorphism. It is easy to see that ξ−1(Iλ) = U(n−) ⊗Kλ,
where
Kλ :=
X
i
U(h ⊕n+)(hi −λ(hi)) +
X
i
U(h ⊕n+)ei
is the kernel of the homomorphism χλ : U(h ⊕n+) →C given by
χλ(h) = λ(h), h ∈h, χλ(ei) = 0. Thus, we have a natural isomorphism
of left U(n−)-modules
U(n−) = U(n−) ⊗U(h ⊕n+)/Kλ →Mλ,
as claimed.
□
Remark 8.6. The deﬁnition of Mλ means that it is the induced mod-
ule U(g) ⊗U(h⊕n+) Cλ, where Cλ is the one-dimensional representation
of h ⊕n+ on which it acts via χλ.
Corollary 8.7. Mλ has a weight decomposition with P(Mλ) = λ−Q+,
dim Mλ[λ] = 1, and weight subspaces of Mλ are ﬁnite-dimensional.
Proposition 8.8. (i) If V is a representation of g and v ∈V is a vector
such that hv = λ(h)v for h ∈h and eiv = 0 then there is a unique
homomorphism η : Mλ →V such that η(vλ) = v. In particular, if V
is generated by such v ̸= 0 (i.e., V is a highest weight representation
with highest weight vector v) then V is a quotient of Mλ.
(ii) Every highest weight representation has a weight decomposition
into ﬁnite-dimensional weight subspaces.
(iii) Every highest weight representation V has a unique highest
weight generator, up to scaling.
Proof. (i) Uniqueness follows from the fact that vλ generates Mλ. To
construct η, note that we have a natural map of g-modules eη : U(g) →
V given by eη(x) = xv. Moreover, eη|Iλ = 0 thanks to the relations sat-
isﬁed by v, so eη descends to a map η : U(g)/Iλ = Mλ →V . Moreover,
if V is generated by v then this map is surjective, as desired.
(ii) This follows from (i) since a quotient of any representation with
a weight decomposition must itself have a weight decomposition.
42

[PAGE 43]
(iii) Suppose v, w are two highest weight generators of V of weights
λ, µ. If λ = µ then they are proportional since dim V [λ] ≤dim Mλ[λ] =
1, as V is a quotient of Mλ. On the other hand, if λ ̸= µ, then we can
assume without loss of generality that λ −µ /∈Q+ (otherwise switch
λ, µ). Then µ /∈λ −Q+, hence µ /∈P(V ), a contradiction.
□
8.3. Irreducible highest weight g-modules.
Proposition 8.9. For every λ ∈h∗, the Verma module Mλ has a
unique irreducible quotient Lλ. Moreover, Lλ is a quotient of every
highest weight g-module V with highest weight λ.
Proof. Let Y ⊂Mλ be a proper submodule. Then Y has a weight de-
composition, and cannot contain a nonzero multiple of vλ (as otherwise
Y = Mλ), so P(Y ) ⊂(λ −Q+) \ {λ}. Now let Jλ be the sum of all
proper submodules Y ⊂Mλ. Then P(Jλ) ⊂(λ −Q+) \ {λ}, so Jλ is
also a proper submodule of Mλ (the maximal one). Thus, Lλ := Mλ/Jλ
is an irreducible highest weight module with highest weight λ. More-
over, if V is any nonzero quotient of Mλ then the kernel K of the
map Mλ →V is a proper submodule, hence contained in Jλ. Thus
the surjective map Mλ →Lλ descends to a surjective map V →Lλ.
The kernel of this map is a proper submodule of V , hence zero if V is
irreducible. Thus in the latter case V ∼= Lλ.
□
Corollary 8.10. Irreducible highest weight g-modules are classiﬁed by
their highest weight λ ∈h∗, via the bijection λ 7→Lλ.
Exercise 8.11. Let g = sl2 with standard generators e, f, h and iden-
tify h∗∼= C via λ 7→λ(h). Show that Mλ is irreducible if λ /∈Z≥0,
while for λ a nonnegative integer we have Jλ = M−λ−2, so Lλ is the
λ + 1-dimensional irreducible representation of sl2.
It is known from the theory of ﬁnite-dimensional representations of
g that its irreducible ﬁnite-dimensional representations are Lλ with
λ ∈P+. Thus we have
Proposition 8.12. Lλ is ﬁnite-dimensional if and only if λ ∈P+.
Note that the “only if” direction of this proposition follows immedi-
ately from Exercise 8.11.
8.4. Exercises.
Exercise 8.13. Let g be a ﬁnite-dimensional simple complex Lie alge-

(vi) For any g, compute the decomposition of g ⊗Lµ, µ ∈P+, where
g is the adjoint representation of g (again use (iv)).
In both (v) and (vi) you should express the answer in terms of the
numbers ki such that µ = P
i kiωi and the Cartan matrix entries of g.
Exercise 8.14. (D. N. Verma) (i) Let g = n−⊕h ⊕n+ be a ﬁnite-
dimensional simple complex Lie algebra, and λ, µ ∈h∗. Show that
every nonzero homomorphism Mµ →Mλ is injective. (Use that U(n−)
44

[PAGE 45]
has no zero divisors). Deduce that if Mλ is reducible then there exists
λ′ ∈λ −Q+, λ′ ̸= λ with Mλ′ ⊂Mλ.
(ii) Show that for every λ ∈h∗there is λ′ ∈λ −Q+ with Mλ′ ⊂Mλ
and Mλ′ irreducible. (Assume the contrary and construct an inﬁnite
sequence of proper inclusions
...Mλ2 ⊂Mλ1 ⊂Mλ.
Then derive a contradiction by looking at the eigenvalues of the qua-
dratic Casimir C ∈U(g)).
(iii) Show that if Mµ is irreducible then dim Homg(Mµ, Mλ) ≤1.
(Look at the growth of the dimensions of weight subspaces).
(iv) Show that dim Homg(Mµ, Mλ) ≤1 for any λ, µ ∈h∗. (Look at
the restriction of a homomorphism Mµ →Mλ to Mµ′ ⊂Mµ which is

Exercise 8.15. (i) Keep the notation of Exercise 8.14. Let λ ∈h∗be
such that (λ, α∨
i ) = n −1 for a positive integer n and simple root αi.
Show that there is an inclusion Mλ−nαi ,→Mλ.
(ii) Let ρ be the sum of fundamental weights of g and W be the Weyl
group of g. For w ∈W, λ ∈h∗let w • λ := w(λ + ρ) −ρ (the shifted
action of W). Deduce from (i) that if λ ∈P+ then for every w ∈W,
there is an inclusion ιw : Mw•λ ,→Mλ, and that if w = w1w2 with
ℓ(w) = ℓ(w1) + ℓ(w2) (where ℓ(w) is the length of w) then ιw factors
through ιw2. In particular, we have an inclusion Mw•λ ,→Mw2•λ.
(iii) Show that Mλ is irreducible unless (λ + ρ, α∨) = 1 for some
α ∈Q+ \ 0, where α∨:=
2α
(α,α) (look at the eigenvalues of the quadratic
Casimir).
(iv) For β ∈Q+ deﬁne the Kostant partition function K(β) to
be the number of unordered representations of β as a sum of positive
roots of g (thus K(β) = dim U(n+)[β]). Also deﬁne the Shapovalov
pairing
Bβ(λ) : U(n+)[β] × U(n−)[−β] →C
by the formula
xyvλ = Bβ(λ)(x, y)vλ,
where x ∈U(n+)[β], y ∈U(n−)[−β], and vλ is the highest weight vector
of Mλ. Let
Dβ(λ) := det Bβ(λ),
the determinant of the matrix of Bβ(λ) in some bases of U(n+)[β], U(n−)[−β].
This is a (non-homogeneous) polynomial in λ well deﬁned up to scaling.

by V0 ⊂V, U0 ⊂U the left and right kernels of B(0). Suppose that
B′(0) is a perfect pairing V0 × U0 →k. Show that the vanishing order
of det B(t) at t = 0 (computed with respect to any bases of V, U)
equals dim V0 = dim U0. (Hint: Pick a basis e1, ..., em of V0, complete
it to a basis e1, ..., en of V . Choose vectors fm+1, ..., fn ∈U such that
B(0)(ei, fj) = δij for m < i, j ≤n. Let f1, ..., fm be the basis U0 dual
to e1, ..., em with respect to B′(0). Show that {fi} is a basis of U and
the determinant of B(t) in the bases {ei}, {fi} equals tm + O(tm+1).)
(vii) Show that if λ is generic on the hyperplane (λ + ρ, α∨) = n for

(Use
Casimir eigenvalues to show that the only irreducible modules which
could occur in the composition series of Mλ are Lλ and Lλ−nα and
apply Exercise 8.14).
(viii) Let λ be as in (vii) and let B(β, t) := Bβ(λ + tα). Show that
B(β, t) satisﬁes the assumption of (vi) for all β.
Hint: Use that ⊕βKerB(β, 0) is naturally identiﬁed with Mλ−nα
and B′(β, 0) restricts on it to a multiple of its Shapovalov form, and
show that one has B′
nα(0)(vλ−nα, vλ−nα) ̸= 0. For the latter, assume
the contrary and show that there exists a homogeneous lift u of vλ−nα
modulo t2 such that Bnα(t)(u, w) = 0 modulo t2 for all w of weight
λ + (t −n)α. Deduce that eiu vanishes modulo t2 for all i. Conclude
that
Cu = ((λ + (t −n)α + ρ)2 −ρ2)u + O(t2)

9. Representations of SL2(R)
9.1. Irreducible (g, K)-modules for SL2(R). Let us now apply the
general theory to the simplest example – representations of the group
G = SL2(R) of real 2 by 2 matrices with determinant 1. Note that
SL2(R) ∼= SU(1, 1), and in this realization the maximal compact sub-
group SO(2) becomes U(1). So we have Lie(G) = g = su(1, 1), hence
gC = sl2(C) with standard basis e, f, h, so that a maximal compact
subgroup K of G consists of elements eith, t ∈[0, 2π). Thus a (g, K)-
module is the same thing as a gC-module with a weight decomposition
and integer weights.
Let us classify irreducible (g, K)-modules M. To this end, recall that
we have the central Casimir element C ∈U(gC) given by
C = fe + (h + 1)2
4
,
and note that by the PBW theorem, U(gC) is free as a right module over
the commutative subalgebra C[h, fe] = C[h, C] with basis 1, f n, en,
n ≥1. Thus if v is a nonzero weight vector of M then M is spanned by
v, f nv, env. It follows that weight subspaces of M are 1-dimensional,
and P(M) is an arithmetic progression with step 2. Thus we have four
cases:
1. P(M) is ﬁnite. Then M = Lm, the m+1-dimensional irreducible
representation.
2.
P(M) is inﬁnite, bounded above.
In this case let v have the
maximal weight m. Then f nv, n ≥0 is a basis of M, and we have
hv = mv, ev = 0. Thus M = Mm is the Verma module with highest
weight m ∈Z. This module is irreducible iﬀm < 0 (Exercise 8.11).
Thus in this case we get modules M−m = M +
−m, m ≥1.
3. P(M) is inﬁnite, bounded below. The situation is completely
parallel (with f replaced by e) and we obtain lowest weight Verma
modules M −
m for m ≥1. The (g, K)-modules M −
m, M +
−m are called the
discrete series modules for m ≥2, and limit of discrete series
for m = 1.
4. P(M) is unbounded on both sides. Let c be the scalar by which
C acts on M. We have two cases – the even case P(M) = 2Z and the
odd case P(M) = 2Z + 1. In both cases we have a basis vn, n ∈P(M)
such that
(4)
hvn = nvn, fvn = vn−2, evn = Λnvn+2,
where Λn ̸= 0. To compute Λn, we write
Λnvn = fevn = (C −(h+1)2
4
)vn = (c −(n+1)2
4
)vn.
48

[PAGE 49]
Thus
Λn = c −(n+1)2
4
.
Let c = s2
4 . Then
(5)
Λn = 1
4(s −1 −n)(s + 1 + n).
Thus we can replace vn by its multiple wn so that
hwn = nwn, fwn = 1
2(s −1 + n)wn−2, ewn = 1
2(s −1 −n)wn+2.
These formulas deﬁne gC-modules for any s ∈C. We will denote these
modules by P±(s) (plus for the even case, minus for the odd case). The
(g, K)-modules P±(s) are called the principal series modules. We
see that P+(s) is irreducible if s /∈2Z + 1 and P−(s) is irreducible iﬀ
s /∈2Z, and P±(s) = P±(−s) in this case.
Moreover, when these conditions fail, we have short exact sequences
0 →L2m →P+(2m + 1) →M +
−2m−2 ⊕M −
2m+2 →0, m ∈Z≥0,
0 →M +
−2m−2 ⊕M −
2m+2 →P+(−2m −1) →L2m →0, m ∈Z≥0,
0 →L2m+1 →P−(2m + 2) →M +
−2m−3 ⊕M −
2m+3 →0, m ∈Z≥0,
0 →M +
−2m−3 ⊕M −
2m+3 →P−(−2m −2) →L2m+1 →0, m ∈Z≥0,
and for s = 0 we have an isomorphism
P−(0) ∼= M +
−1 ⊕M −
1 .
All these modules except P−(0) are indecomposable. Thus we see that
P±(s) ≇P±(−s) when it is reducible and s ̸= 0.
As a result, we get
Proposition 9.1. The simple (g, K)-modules (or equivalently, Harish-
Chandra modules) are Lm, m ∈Z≥0, M −
m, M +
−m, m ∈Z≥1, and P+(s),
s /∈2Z + 1, P−(s), s /∈2Z, with the only isomorphisms P±(s) ∼=
P±(−s).
Exercise 9.2. Let eP+(s), eP−(s) be the modules deﬁned by (4),(5);
so they are isomorphic to P+(s), P−(s) when s is not an odd integer,
respectively not a nonzero even integer. But we will consider eP+(s)
when s = 2k +1 and eP−(s) when s = 2k, k ̸= 0 (where k is an integer).
(i) Compute the Jordan-H¨older series of eP+(s), eP−(s) and show that
they are uniserial, i.e., have a unique ﬁltration with irreducible succes-
sive quotients.
(ii) Do there exist isomorphisms eP+(s) ∼= P+(s), eP−(s) ∼= P−(s)?
49

[PAGE 50]
9.2. Realizations. Let us discuss realizations of these representations
by admissible representations of G. For Lm there is nothing to discuss,
so we’ll focus on principal series and discrete series.
The realization of principal series has already been discussed in Ex-
ample 5.3. Namely, let B ⊂G be the subgroup of upper triangular
matrices b with diagonal entries (t(b), t(b)−1). As before we consider
the spaces
V+(s) = {F ∈C∞(G) : F(gb) = F(g)|t(b)|s−1},
V−(s) = {F ∈C∞(G) : F(gb) = F(g)|t(b)|s−1sign(t(b))}.
These are admissible representations of G acting by left multipli-
cation. Let us compute V±(s)ﬁn. To this end, note that the group
K = U(1) = S1 acts transitively on G/B with stabilizer Z/2 = {±1}.
Thus, pulling the function F back to K, we can realize V±(s) as the
space V± of functions F ∈C∞(S1) such F(−z) = ±F(z).
A more geometric way of thinking about this is the following. Given
a Lie group G and a closed subgroup B with Lie algebras g, b, every
ﬁnite-dimensional representation V of B gives rise to a vector bundle
EV := (G × V )/B over G/B, where the action of B on G × V is given
by (g, v)b = (gb, b−1v). For example, the tangent bundle T(G/B) is
obtained from the representation V = g/b. In our example, g/b is the
1-dimensional representation of B given by b 7→t(b)−2. Thus sections
of the tangent bundle on G/B (i.e., vector ﬁelds) can be interpreted as
functions F on G such that
F(gb) = F(g)t(b)2.
It follows that elements of V+(s) can be interpreted as sections of the
bundle K
1−s
2
where K = T ∗(G/B) is the canonical bundle, which co-
incides with the cotangent bundle since dim(G/B) = 1 (this bundle is
trivial topologically but the action of diﬀeomorphisms of G/B = S1,
in particular, of elements of SL2(R) on its sections depends on s). In
other words, elements of V+(s) can be interpreted as “tensor ﬁelds of
non-integer rank”: φ(u)(d argu)
1−s
2 , where u = eiθ, θ is the angle coor-
dinate on G/B = RP1 and φ is a smooth function. Similarly, elements
of V−(s) can be interpreted as expressions u
1
2φ(u)(d argu)
1−s
2 , i.e., two-
valued smooth sections of the same bundle which change sign when one
goes around the circle. Thus the Lie algebra action on these modules
is by the vector ﬁelds
h = 2u∂u, f = ∂u, e = −u2∂u,
but they act on elements of V±(s) not as on functions but as on tensor
ﬁelds.
Thus V±(s)ﬁn ⊂V±(s) is the subspace of vectors such that
50

[PAGE 51]
φ ∈C[u, u−1]. Taking the basis w2k = uk(d argu)
1−s
2
in the even case
and w2k+1 = uk+ 1
2(d argu)
1−s
2
in the odd case, we have
hwn = nwn, fwn = 1
2(s −1 + n)wn−2, ewn = 1
2(s −1 −n)wn+2.
Thus we get that V±(s)ﬁn ∼= P±(s) for all s ∈C.
In particular, at points where P±(s) are reducible, this gives realiza-
tions of the discrete series. Namely, consider the modules V+(−r) for
odd r ≥1 and V−(−r) for even r ≥1. The space V+(−r) consists of
elements φ(u)(du
iu )
1+r
2
where φ is smooth (note that d argu = du
iu ). So
it has the subrepresentation V0
+(−r) of forms that extend holomorphi-
cally to the disk |u| ≤1. Thus means that φ(u) = P
N≥0 aNuN+ 1+r
2 ,
where aN is a rapidly decaying sequence (faster than any power of N).
In other words, V0
+(−r) consists of elements ψ(u)(du)
1+r
2 , where ψ is
smooth on the disk |u| ≤1 and holomorphic for |u| < 1. Thus the
eigenvalues of h on V0
+(−r) are 1 + r + 2N, hence V0
+(−r)ﬁn = M −
r+1.
Also, V+(−r) has a subrepresentation V∞
+ (−r) of forms that ex-
tend holomorphically to |u| ≥1 (including inﬁnity), which means that
φ(u) = P
N≥0 aNu−N−1+r
2 .
In other words, V∞
+ (−r) consists of ele-
ments ψ(u−1)(du−1)
1+r
2 , where ψ is smooth on the disk |u| ≤1 and
holomorphic for |u| < 1. Thus we get V∞
+ (−r)ﬁn = M +
−r−1.
Similarly, for even r we get V0
−(−r)ﬁn = M −
r+1, V∞
−(−r)ﬁn = M +
−r−1.
9.3. Unitary representations. These Fr´echet space realizations can
easily be made Hilbert space realizations, by completing with respect
to the usual L2-norm given by
∥φ∥2 = 1
2π
Z 2π
0
|φ(eiθ)|2dθ.
However, this norm is only preserved by G when s is imaginary. In this
case we obtain that the completed representations bV±(s), in particular
bV0
−(0), bV∞
−(0), are unitary. It follows that the Harish-Chandra modules
P±(s) for s ∈iR and M −
1 , M +
−1 are unitary.
It turns out, however, that there are other irreducible unitary repre-
sentations. Let us classify them. It suﬃces to classify irreducible uni-
tary Harish-Chandra modules. Note that the relevant anti-involution
on g is given by e† = −f, f † = −e, h† = h. Let M be irreducible and
v ∈M a vector of weight n. Then if (, ) is an invariant Hermitian form
on M then
(ev, ev) = −(fev, v) = ((n+1
2 )2 −c)(v, v),
51

[PAGE 52]
where c is a Casimir eigenvalue on M. We see that a nonzero invariant
Hermitian form exists iﬀc = s2
4 ∈R, and such a form can be chosen
positive deﬁnite iﬀc < (n+1
2 )2 for every n ∈P(M). This shows that
all discrete series representations are unitary and also determines the
unitarity range of s for the principal series representations. Thus we
obtain the following theorem.
Theorem 9.3. (Gelfand-Naimark [GN], Bargmann [Ba]). The irre-
ducible unitary representations of SL2(R) are Hilbert space completions
of the following unitary Harish-Chandra modules:
• Discrete series and limit of discrete series M −
m, M +
−m, m ∈Z≥1;
• Unitary principal series P±(s), s ∈iR, s ̸= 0;
• The complementary series P+(s), s ∈R, 0 < |s| < 1;
• The trivial representation C.
Here P±(s) ∼= P±(−s) and there are no other isomorphisms.
Let us discuss explicit Hilbert space realizations of the unitary rep-
resentations. We have already described such unitary realizations of
principal series in L2(S1), except the complementary series. For dis-
crete series we only gave realizations for m = 1, as M −
1 , M +
−1 are direct
summands in P−(0). However, one can give a realization for any m. To
this end, note that G = SL2(R) acts by fractional linear transforma-
tions on the disk |u| ≤1. Moreover, we have the Poincar´e (hyperbolic)
metric on the disk which is G-invariant. The volume element for this
metric looks like
µ =
dudu
(1 −|u|2)2.
Thus for expressions ω = ψ(u)(du)
m
2 where m ≥2 is an integer and
ψ(u) is holomorphic for |u| < 1 we may deﬁne the G-invariant norm
∥ω∥2 =
Z
|u|<1
ωω
µ
m
2 −1 =
Z
|u|<1
|ψ(u)|2(1 −|u|2)m−2dudu.
Hence the Hilbert space completion c
M −
m may be realized as the space
Hm of holomorphic
m
2 -forms ω = ψ(u)(du)
m
2 for |u| < 1 for which
∥ω∥2 < ∞(note that this space is nonzero only if m ≥2).
Likewise, c
M +
−m can be similarly realized via antiholomorphic forms.
Indeed, conjugation by the matrix

0
1
1
0

(of determinant −1) deﬁnes
an outer automorphism of SL2(R) which is induced by complex con-
jugation on the unit disk, and this automorphism exchanges M −
m with
M +
−m.

Exercise 9.4. Let Gℓbe the ℓ-fold cover of PSL2(R) (for example,
G1 = PSL2(R), G2 = SL2(R)). Classify irreducible admissible rep-
resentations (up to inﬁnitesimal equivalence) and irreducible unitary
representations of Gℓfor all ℓ.
Hint. The maximal compact subgroup of Gℓis Kℓ, the ℓ-fold cover
of PSO(2). Thus irreducible Harish-Chandra modules for Gℓare ir-
reducible sl2(C)-modules on which the element h acts diagonalizably
with eigenvalues in 2
ℓZ.
Exercise 9.5. Compute the matrix coeﬃcients of the principal series
modules, ψm,n(g) = (wm, gwn), g ∈SL2(R).
Hint. Write g as g = U1DU2 where
Uk = exp(iθkh) ∈SO(2), θk ∈R/2πZ
for k = 1, 2 and D = diag(a, a−1) is diagonal, and express ψm,n(g) as
ei(nθ2−mθ1)ψ(m, n, a, s). Write the function ψ(m, n, a, s) in terms of the
Gauss hypergeometric function 2F1.
Exercise 9.6. (i) Show that for −1 < s < 0 the formula
(f, g)s :=
Z
R2 f(y)g(z)|y −z|−s−1dydz
deﬁnes a positive deﬁnite inner product on the space C0(R) of continu-
ous functions f : R →C with compact support (Hint: pass to Fourier
transforms).
(ii) Deduce that if f is a measurable function on R then
0 ≤(f, f)s ≤∞,
so measurable functions f with (f, f)s < ∞modulo those for which
(f, f)s = 0 form a Hilbert space Hs with inner product (, )s, which is
the completion of C0(R) under (, )s.
(iii) Let us view Hs as the space of tensor ﬁelds f(y)(dy)
1−s
2 , where
f is as in (ii). Show that the complementary series unitary representa-
tion bP+(s) of SL2(R) may be realized in Hs with G acting naturally on
such tensor ﬁelds. (Hint: show that the diﬀerential form
dydz
(y−z)2 is in-
variant under simultaneous M¨obius transformations of y, z by the same
matrix).

10. Chevalley restriction theorem and
Chevalley-Shephard-Todd theorem
10.1. Chevalley restriction theorem. Let g be a semisimple com-
plex Lie algebra with Cartan subalgebra h, and let W be the corre-
sponding Weyl group. Given F ∈C[g]g, let Res(F) be its restriction
to h.
Theorem 10.1. (Chevalley restriction theorem) (i) Res(F) ∈C[h]W.
(ii) The map Res : C[g]g →C[h]W is a graded algebra isomorpohism.
Proof. (i) Let G be the adjoint complex Lie group corresponding to
g. Then C[g]g = C[g]G, so F is G-invariant. Thus, denoting by H
the maximal torus in G with LieH = h, we see that the normalizer
N(H) preserves Res(F). Since H acts trivially on h, we get that W =
N(H)/H preserves Res(F), as desired.
(ii) It is clear that Res is a graded algebra homomorphism, so we just
need to show that it is bijective. The injectivity of this map follows
immediately from the fact that Res(F) determines the values of F on
the subset of semisimple elements gs ⊂g, and this subset is dense in g.
It remains to prove the surjectivity of Res. Consider the functions
Fλ,n(x) := TrLλ(xn) = χλ(xn), x ∈g
in C[g]g, where χλ is the character of Lλ. We’ll show that the functions
Res(Fλ,n) for various λ span C[h]W[n] = (Snh∗)W for each n, which
implies that Res is surjective.
To this end, for every dominant integral weight λ ∈P+ let mλ be
the orbit sum
mλ :=
X
µ∈Wλ
eµ ∈C[P]W.
We have
χλ =
X
µ≤λ
Nλµmµ,
where µ ≤λ means that λ −µ is a (possibly empty) sum of positive
roots, and Nλµ is the matrix of weight multiplicities (in particular,
Nλλ = 1). This matrix is triangular with ones on the diagonal, so we
can invert it and get
(6)
mλ =
X
µ≤λ
e
Nλµχµ
for some integers e
Nλµ. Now, for h ∈h, let
Mλ,n(h) :=
X
µ∈Wλ
µ(h)n = |Wλ|
|W|
X
w∈W
λ(wh)n.
54

[PAGE 55]
(note that µ(x)n = µ(xn)). By (6) we have
Mλ,n(h) =
X
µ≤λ
e
NλµFµ,n(h).
Thus it suﬃces to show that Mλ,n(h) for various λ span (Snh∗)W[n] for
each n. Since averaging over W is a surjection Snh∗→(Snh∗)W, it
suﬃces to show that the functions λn for λ ∈P+ span Snh∗.
Denote the span of these functions by Y . Since P+ is Zariski dense
in h∗, we ﬁnd that λn ∈Y for all λ ∈h∗.
Thus Y ⊂Snh∗is a
subrepresentation of GL(h∗). But Snh∗is an irreducible representation
of GL(h∗), hence Y = Snh∗. This completes the proof of (ii).
□
Remark 10.2. 1. Since the Killing form allows us to identify g ∼= g∗
and h ∼= h∗, the Chevalley restriction theorem is equivalent to the
statement that the restriction map Res : C[g∗]g = (Sg)g →C[h∗]W =
(Sh)W is a graded algebra isomorphism.
2. The Chevalley restriction theorem trivially generalizes to reduc-
tive Lie algebras.
Example 10.3. Let g = gln(C). Then by the fundamental theorem
on symmetric functions, C[h]W = C[x1, ..., xn]Sn = C[e1, ..., en] where
ei(x1, ..., xn) =
X
k1<...<ki
xk1...xki
are elementary symmetric functions.
The Chevalley restriction the-
orem thus says that restriction deﬁnes an isomorphism between the
algebra C[g]g of conjugation-invariant polynomials of a single matrix
A and C[e1, ..., en]. Namely, let ai := Tr(∧iA) be the coeﬃcients of the
characteristic polynomial of A (up to sign). Then C[g]g = C[a1, ..., an]
and ai|h = ei(x1, ..., xn). Another set of generators are bi := Tr(Ai),
1 ≤i ≤n; we have bi|h = pi(x1, ..., xn), where
pi(x1, ..., xn) :=
n
X
k=1
xi
k
are the power sums, another set of generators of the algebra of sym-
metric functions. Yet another generating set is ci := Tr(SiA) which
restrict to complete symmetric functions
hi(x1, ..., xn) =
X
k1≤...≤ki
xk1...xki.
Thus
ai(A) = ei(x1, ...., xn), bi(A) = pi(x1, ..., xn), ci(A) = hi(x1, ..., xn),
55

[PAGE 56]
where x1, ..., xn are the eigenvalues of A. Note that a1(A) = b1(A) =
c1(A) = Tr(A) and an(A) = det A.
For g = sln (type An−1), the story is the same, except that e1 = p1 =
h1 = 0 and a1 = b1 = c1 = 0, so they should be removed.
Example 10.4. Similarly, for g = so2n+1(C) and g = sp2n(C) (types
Bn and Cn) we have
C[h]W = C[x1, ..., xn]Sn⋉(Z/2)n =
C[x2
1, ..., x2
n]Sn = C[e2, e4, ..., e2n] = C[p2, p4, ..., p2n] = C[h2, h4, ..., h2n],
where ek, pk, hk are symmetric functions of 2n variables evaluated at the
point (x1, ..., xn, −xn, ..., −x1), and e2i = a2i|h, p2i = b2i|h, h2i = c2i|h
(note that the odd-indexed symmetric functions evaluate to 0). This
is so because the eigenvalues of A are x1, ..., xn, −xn, ..., −x1, and also
0 in the orthogonal case.
The case g = so2n(C) (type Dn) is a bit trickier. In this case the
Weyl group is W = Sn ⋉(Z/2)n
+, where (Z/2)n
+ is the group of binary
n-dimensional vectors with zero sum of coordinates. Thus it is easy to
check that
C[h]W = C[e2, ..., e2n−2, √e2n].
where ej = ej(x1, ..., xn, −xn, ..., −x1). The polynomial √e2n = inx1...xn
is the restriction of the Pfaﬃan Pf(A) =
√
det A. Thus
C[g]g = C[a2(A), ..., a2n−2(A), Pf(A)].
The generators of C[g]g for exceptional g are less explicit, however.
10.2. Chevalley-Shephard-Todd theorem, part I. In Examples
10.3, 10.4 we observe that the algebras C[h]W of Weyl group invariant
polynomials for classical groups are free (polynomial) algebras. This
is not true for a general ﬁnite group: e.g. if G = Z/2 acting on C2
by (x, y) 7→(−x, −y) then the ring of invariants C[x, y]Z/2 is C[a, b, c]
where a = x2, b = xy, c = y2, and it is not free – it has a relation ac = b2
(and the set of generators is minimal). It turns out, however, that this is
true for all Weyl groups and more generally complex reﬂection groups.
Deﬁnition 10.5. A diagonalizable automorphism g : V →V of a
ﬁnite-dimensional complex vector space V is called a complex reﬂec-
tion if rank(g−1) = 1; in other words, in some basis g = diag(λ, 1, ..., 1)
where λ ̸= 0, 1. A complex reﬂection group is a ﬁnite subgroup
G ⊂GL(V ) generated by complex reﬂections.
For example, the Weyl group W ⊂GL(h) of a semisimple Lie algebra
g and, more generally, a ﬁnite Coxeter group is a complex reﬂection
group, but there are others, e.g. Sn ⋉(Z/m)n acting on Cn for m > 2,
56

or, more generally, the subgroup G(m, d, n) in this group consisting of
elements for which the sum of Z/m-coordinates lies in d·Z/m for some
divisor d of m.
It is easy to see that any complex reﬂection group is uniquely a prod-
uct of irreducible ones, and irreducible complex reﬂection groups were
classiﬁed by Shephard and Todd in 1954. Besides symmetric groups Sn
acting on Cn−1 and G(m, d, n) acting on Cn (which includes dihedral
groups), there are 34 exceptional groups, which include 19 subgroups of
GL2, 6 exceptional Coxeter groups of rank ≥3 (H3, H4, F4, E6, E7, E8),
and 9 other groups.
Theorem 10.6. (Chevalley-Shephard-Todd theorem, part I, [Che], [ST])
Let V be a ﬁnite-dimensional complex vector space and G ⊂GL(V ) be
a ﬁnite subgroup. Then C[V ]G is a polynomial algebra if and only if G
is a complex reﬂection group.

11. Proof of the CST theorem, part I
11.1. Proof of the CST theorem, part I, the “if” direction. We
ﬁrst need a lemma from invariant theory. Let G ⊂GL(V ) be a ﬁnite
subgroup, and I ⊂C[V ] be the ideal generated by positive degree
elements of C[V ]G. Let f1, ..., fr ∈C[V ]G be homogeneous generators
of I (which exist by the Hilbert basis theorem).
Lemma 11.1. The algebra C[V ]G is generated by f1, ..., fr; in partic-
ular, it is ﬁnitely generated.
Proof. We need to show that every homogeneous f ∈C[V ]G is a poly-
nomial of f1, ..., fr. The proof is by induction in d = deg f. The base
d = 0 is obvious. If d > 0, we have f ∈I, so
f = s1f1 + ... + srfr
where si ∈C[V ] are homogeneous of degrees < d.
For h ∈C[V ] let h∗:=
1
|G|
P
g∈G gh ∈C[V ]G be the G-average of h.
Then we have
f = s∗
1f1 + ... + s∗
rfr.
But by the induction assumption, s∗
i are polynomials of f1, .., fr, which
proves the lemma.
□
Remark 11.2. Let A be a ﬁnitely generated commutative C-algebra
with an action of a ﬁnite group G. Lemma 11.1 implies that the algebra
AG is also ﬁnitely generated (the Hilbert-Noether lemma). Indeed,
pick generators a1, ..., am of A and let V ⊂A be the (ﬁnite-dimensional)
G-submodule generated by them. Then AG is a quotient of (SV )G =
C[V ∗]G, which is ﬁnitely generated by Lemma 11.1.
The next lemma establishes a special property of algebras of invari-
ants of complex reﬂection groups which will allow us to prove that they
are polynomial algebras.
Lemma 11.3. Assume that G is a complex reﬂection group. Let I
be as above, F1, ..., Fm ∈C[V ]G be homogeneous, and suppose that F1
does not belong to the ideal in C[V ]G generated by F2, ..., Fm. Suppose
gi ∈C[V ] for 1 ≤i ≤m are homogeneous and Pm
i=1 giFi = 0. Then
g1 ∈I.
Proof. Let J = (F2, ..., Fm) ⊂C[V ]. We claim that F1 /∈J. Indeed, if
F1 = s2F2 + ... + smFm then F1 = s∗
2F2 + ... + s∗
mFm, contradicting our
assumption.
We prove the lemma by induction in D := deg g1. If D = 0 then
g1 = 0, as F1 /∈J. This establishes the base of induction.
58

[PAGE 59]
Now assume D > 0. Let σ ∈G be a complex reﬂection and α be
the linear function on V deﬁning the reﬂection hyperplane V σ (i.e., the
eigenvector of σ in V ∗with eigenvalue ̸= 1). Then σgi −gi vanishes on
V σ, so is divisible by α. Thus
σgi −gi = hiα
for some polynomials hi with deg hi = deg gi −1, in particular deg h1 =
D −1. Applying the operator σ −1 to the relation Pm
i=1 giFi = 0 and
dividing by α, we obtain
m
X
i=1
hiFi = 0.
By the induction assumption h1 ∈I, so σg1 −g1 ∈I. Since W is
generated by complex reﬂections, this implies that wg1 −g1 ∈I
for any w ∈G. Thus g∗
1 −g1 ∈I. But g∗
1 is a positive degree invariant,
so g∗
1 ∈I. Hence g1 ∈I, which justiﬁes the induction step.
□
Now we are ready to prove the “if” direction of the Chevalley-
Shephard-Todd theorem. Suppose that f1, ..., fr ∈C[V ]G are homoge-
nous of positive degree and form a minimal set of homogeneous gener-
ators of I.
Lemma 11.4. f1, ..., fr are algebraically independent.
Proof. Assume the contrary, i.e.,
(7)
h(f1, ..., fr) = 0,
where h(y1, ..., yr) is a nonconstant polynomial. Let di := deg fi. We
may assume that h is quasi-homogeneous (with deg yi = di), of the
lowest possible degree. Let xk be linear coordinates on V , ∂k :=
∂
∂xk .
Diﬀerentiating (7) with respect to xk and using the chain rule, we get
(8)
r
X
j=1
hj(f)∂kfj = 0,
where f := (f1, ..., fr) and hj :=
∂h
∂yj . By renumbering fj if needed,
we may assume that h1(f), ..., hm(f) is a minimal generating set of the
ideal (h1(f), ..., hr(f)) ⊂C[V ]. Moreover, since h is nonconstant, hj ̸= 0
for some j ∈[1, r], and since h is of lowest degree, this implies that
hj(f) ̸= 0. So m ≥1. Then for i > m we have
hi(f) =
m
X
j=1
gijhj(f)
59

[PAGE 60]
for some homogeneous polynomials gij ∈C[V ] of degree
deg hi −deg hj = dj −di.
Substituting this into (8), we get
m
X
j=1
pjhj(f) = 0,
where
pj := ∂kfj +
r
X
i=m+1
gij∂kfi.
Since h1(f) /∈(h2(f), ..., hm(f)), by Lemma 11.3 applied to Fi = hi(f),
1 ≤i ≤m, we have p1 ∈I. Thus
∂kf1 +
r
X
i=m+1
gi1∂kfi =
r
X
i=1
qikfi,
where qik ∈C[V ] are homogeneous of degree d1−di−1. Let us multiply
this equation by xk and add over all k. Then we get
(9)
d1f1 +
r
X
i=m+1
gi1difi =
r
X
i=1
qifi,
where qi := P
k xkqik. In particular, qi are homogeneous of strictly
positive degree.
All terms in this equation are homogeneous of the
same degree d1, so we must have q1 = 0. Thus (9) implies that f1 ∈
(f2, ..., fr), a contradiction with our minimality assumption.
□
Now, by Lemmas 11.4 and 11.1, we have C[V ]G = C[f1, ..., fr]. This
proves the “if” direction of the Chevalley-Shephard-Todd theorem.
Remark 11.5. Note that r = trdeg(C(V )G) = trdeg(C(V )) = n,
where n = dim V and trdeg denotes the transcendence degree of a ﬁeld,
since transcendence degree does not change under ﬁnite extensions.
11.2. A lemma on group actions.
Lemma 11.6. Let U be an aﬃne space over C and G a ﬁnite group
acting on U by polynomial automorphisms.
(i) Let u ∈U be a point with trivial stabilizer in G. Then there exists
a local coordinate system on U near u consisting of elements of C[U]G.
(ii) Maximal ideals in C[U]G (i.e., characters χ : C[U]G →C) are in
bijection with G-orbits on U, which assigns to an orbit Gu the character
χu(f) := f(u). Thus the set of maximal ideals in C[U]G is U/G.
60

[PAGE 61]
Proof. (i) Pick a basis {ei} of T ∗
uU. Since gu ̸= u for any g ∈G, g ̸= 1,
there exist yi ∈C[U], 1 ≤i ≤dim U such that the linear approximation
of yi at gu is zero for all g ̸= 1, yi(u) = 0, and dyi(u) = ei. Let y∗
i be
the average of yi over G. Then {y∗
i } form a required coordinate system.
(ii) Suppose v, u ∈U, v /∈Gu, then Gu ∩Gv = ∅, so there exists
f ∈C[U] such that f|Gv = 0, f|Gu = 1. Moreover, by replacing f by
f ∗, we may choose such f ∈C[U]G. Then χv(f) = 0 while χu(f) = 1, so
χu ̸= χv, hence u 7→χu is injective. To show that it’s also surjective,
take a maximal ideal m ⊂C[U]G.
It generates an ideal I ⊂C[U]
whose projection to C[U]G is m. Thus I is a proper ideal, so by the
Nullstellensatz, its zero set Z ⊂U is non-empty. Let u ∈Z, then for
any f ∈m, χu(f) = f(u) = 0. Hence m = Kerχu, as desired.
□
11.3. Proof of the CST theorem, part I, the “only if” direction.
14
Let G ⊂GL(V ) be a ﬁnite subgroup. Let H be the normal subgroup
of G generated by the complex reﬂections of G. Then by the “if” part
of the theorem, C[V ]H is a polynomial algebra with an action of G/H.
In other words, using Lemma 11.6(ii), U := V/H is an aﬃne space
with a (possibly non-linear) action of G/H.
Moreover, we claim that G/H acts freely on U outside of a set of
codimension ≥2. Indeed, if 1 ̸= s ∈G/H and a ∈s then a is not a
reﬂection, so Ys := ∪a∈sV a has codimension ≥2. Now, for any v in the
preimage of U s in V and a ∈s we have av = h−1v for some h ∈H,
thus hav = v and v ∈Ys. Thus U s is contained in the image of Ys in
U, hence codim(U s) ≥2, as claimed.
Now assume that C[V ]G is a polynomial algebra, and let V/G = W
be the corresponding aﬃne space. Consider the natural regular map
η : V/H = U →V/G = W between n-dimensional aﬃne spaces, and
let J ∈C[U] be the Jacobian of this map (well deﬁned up to scaling).
If u ∈U and the stabilizer of u in G/H is trivial then by Lemma 11.6,
η is ´etale at u, hence J(u) ̸= 0. But as shown above, the complement
of such points has codimension ≥2. This implies that J = const, as
a nonconstant polynomial would vanish on a subset of codimension 1.
Thus by the inverse function theorem η is an isomorphism near 0, in
particular bijective, hence H = G.
Remark 11.7. Let X be an smooth aﬃne algebraic variety over C
and G be a ﬁnite group of automorphisms of X. Then by the Hilbert-
Noether lemma, C[X]G is ﬁnitely generated, so X/G := SpecC[X]G
is an aﬃne algebraic variety. The Chevalley-Shephard-Todd theorem
14This proof uses some very basic algebraic geometry.
61

[PAGE 62]
implies that X/G is smooth at the image x∗∈X/G of x ∈X if and
only if the stabilizer Gx of x is a complex reﬂection group in GL(TxX).
In particular, X/G is smooth iﬀall stabilizers are complex reﬂection
groups. This follows from the formal Cartan lemma: any action of a
ﬁnite group G on a formal polydisk D over a ﬁeld of characteristic zero
is equivalent to its linearization (i.e., to the action of G on the formal
neighborhood of 0 in the tangent space to D at its unique geometric
point).

12. Chevalley-Shephard-Todd theorem, part II
12.1. Degrees of a complex reﬂection group. The degrees di of the
generators fi of C[V ]G for a complex reﬂection group G are uniquely
determined up to relabelings (even though fi themselves are not). In-
deed, recall that for a Z-graded vector space M with ﬁnite-dimensional
homogeneous components its Hilbert series is
H(M, q) =
X
i∈Z
dim M[i]qi
(also called Hilbert polynomial if dim M < ∞). Then the Hilbert series
of C[V ]G is
H(C[V ]G, q) =
1
Qr
i=1(1 −qdi),
which uniquely determines di. These numbers are usually arranged in
non-decreasing order and are called the degrees of G. For instance,
for Weyl groups of classical simple Lie algebras we saw in Examples
10.3,10.4 that in type An−1 the degrees are 2, 3, ..., n, for Bn and Cn
they are 2, 4, ..., 2n, and for Dn they are 2, 4, ..., 2n −2 and n.
In
particular, in the last case, if n is even, the degree n occurs twice.
12.2. C[V ] as a C[V ]G-module. Let R be a commutative ring. Let A
be a commutative R-algebra with an R-linear action of a ﬁnite group
G.
Proposition 12.1. (Hilbert-Noether theorem) (i) A is integral over
AG. In particular, if A ﬁnitely generated then it is module-ﬁnite over
AG.
(ii) If R is Noetherian and A is ﬁnitely generated then so is AG.
Proof. (i) We will prove only the ﬁrst statement, as the second one
then follows immediately. For a ∈A, consider the monic polynomial
Pa(x) :=
Y
g∈G
(x −ga).
It is easy to see that Pa ∈AG[x] and Pa(a) = 0, which implies the
statement.
(ii) This follows from (i) and the Artin-Tate lemma: If B ⊂A is
an R-subalgebra of a ﬁnitely generated R-algebra A over a Noetherian
ring R and A is module-ﬁnite over B then B is ﬁnitely generated.15
□
15Recall the proof of the Artin-Tate lemma. Let x1, ..., xm generate A as an
R-algebra and let y1, ..., yn generate A as a B-module. Then we can write
xi =
X
j
bijyj,
yiyj =
X
k
bijkyk
63

[PAGE 64]
This shows for any ﬁnite G ⊂GL(V ), the algebra C[V ] is module-
ﬁnite over C[V ]G.
Note that in (ii) we again proved that C[V ]G is
ﬁnitely generated.
Theorem 12.2. (Chevalley-Shephard-Todd theorem, part II, [Che],
[ST]) If G is a complex reﬂection group then for any irreducible rep-
resentation ρ of G, the C[V ]G-module HomG(ρ, C[V ]) is free of rank
dim ρ. Thus the G-module R0 = C[x1, ..., xn]/(f1, ..., fn) is the regular
representation and Qn
i=1 di = |G|. Moreover, the Hilbert polynomial
H(R0, q) := P
N≥0 dim R0[N]qN is
H(R0, q) =
n
Y
i=1
[di]q,
where [d]q := 1−qd
1−q = 1 + q + ... + qd−1.
Thus we see that the Hilbert polynomial of HomG(ρ, R0) is some
polynomial Kρ(q) with nonnegative integer coeﬃcients and Kρ(1) =
dim ρ. It is called the Kostka polynomial. We have
X
ρ
Kρ(q) dim ρ = H(R0, q) =
n
Y
i=1
[di]q.
For example, for G = S3 and V the reﬂection representation we have
three irreducible representations: C+ (trivial), C−(sign) and V . We
have KC+(q) = 1 and
1 + 2KV (q) + KC−(q) = (1 + q)(1 + q2) = 1 + 2q + 2q2 + q3.
It follows that
KV (q) = q + q2, KC−(q) = q3.
12.3. Graded modules. For the proof of Theorem 12.2 we need to
recall some basics from commutative algebra, which we discuss in the
next few subsections.
Let k be a ﬁeld, S a Z+-graded (not necessarily commutative) k-
algebra with generators fi of positive integer degrees deg fi = di, M a
Z+-graded left S-module, and M0 := M/S+M, where S+ ⊂S is the
augmentation ideal.
with bij, bijk ∈B. Then A is module-ﬁnite over the R-algebra B0 ⊂B generated
by bij, bijk (namely, it is generated as a module over B0 by the yi). Using that R
and hence B0 is Noetherian, we obtain that B is also module-ﬁnite over B0. Since
B0 is a ﬁnitely generated R-algebra, so is B.
64

[PAGE 65]
Lemma 12.3. (i) Any homogeneous lift {v∗
i } of a homogeneous basis
{vi} of M0 to M is a system of generators for M; in particular, if
dim M0 < ∞then M is ﬁnitely generated.
(ii) If in addition M is projective, then {v∗
i } is actually a basis of M
(in particular, M is free). Thus if dim M0[i] < ∞for all i then
H(M, q) = H(M0, q)H(S, q).
In particular, if S = k[f1, ..., fn] then
H(M, q) =
H(M0, q)
Qn
i=1(1 −qdi).
Proof. (i) We prove that any homogeneous element u ∈M is a linear
combination of v∗
i with coeﬃcients in S by induction in deg u (with
obvious base). Namely, if u0 is the image of u in M0 then u0 = P
i civi
for some ci ∈k (ci = 0 unless deg vi = deg u), and so
u −

i
civ∗
i =

fjuj,
with uj ∈M, deg uj = deg u −dj. So by the induction assumption
uj =

for some homogeneous pij ∈S of degree deg u−dj −deg v∗
i , and we get
u =
X
i
piv∗
i ,
where pi := ci + P
j fjpij.16
(ii) Let M ′ be the free graded S-module with basis wi of degrees
deg wi = deg vi, and f : M ′ →M be the surjection sending wi to v∗
i .
Since M is projective, the map
f◦: Hom(M, M ′) →Hom(M, M)
is surjective, so we can pick a homogeneous g : M →M ′ of degree 0
such that f ◦g = idM. Then g ◦f : M ′ →M ′ is a projection which
identiﬁes M ′ with M ⊕Kerf as a graded S-module.
But the map
f0 : M ′
0 →M0 induced by f sends the basis wi of M ′
0 to the basis vi
of M0, so is an isomorphism. It follows that (Kerf)0 = 0, so Kerf = 0
and f is an isomorphism, as claimed.
□
16Note that for each i, one of these two summands is necessarily 0.

[PAGE 66]
12.4. Koszul complexes. Let R be a commutative ring and f ∈R.
Then we can deﬁne a 2-step Koszul complex KR(f) = [R →R] with
the diﬀerential given by multiplication by f (the two copies of R sit in
degrees −1 and 0). We have H0(KR(f)) = R/(f), and KR(f) is exact
in degree −1 if and only if f is not a zero divisor in R. This allows us
to deﬁne the Koszul complex of several elements of R:
KR(f1, ..., fm) = KR(f1) ⊗R ... ⊗R KR(fm)
with H0(KR(f1, ..., fm)) = R/(f1, ..., fm). Thus
KR(f1, ..., fm) = KR(f1, ..., fm−1) ⊗R KR(fm).
For example, let R := k[x1, ..., xn] for a ﬁeld k.
Then the com-
plex Kn := KR(x1, ..., xn) = K⊗n
1
is acyclic in negative degrees and
has H0 = k.
Thus for any commutative k-algebra S, the complex
KR⊗S(x1, ..., xn) := KR(x1, ..., xn) ⊗S is acyclic in negative degrees
and has H0 = S. By taking S = R and making a linear change of
variable, this yields a free resolution of R as an R-bimodule called the
Koszul resolution, which we’ll denote it by Kn:
0 →R⊗∧nkn ⊗R →... →R⊗∧2kn ⊗R →R⊗kn ⊗R →R⊗R →R.
Moreover, this exact sequence is split as a sequence of R-modules (un-
der right multiplication by R), since all participating R-modules are
free. Hence if M is any R-module then Kn ⊗R M is a free resolution
of M of length n. Thus we obtain
Proposition 12.4. If i > n then for any k[x1, ..., xn]-modules M, N,
one has Exti(M, N) = 0.
12.5. Syzygies. Now assume that M is a ﬁnitely generated graded
module over R = k[x1, ..., xn]. Then M =: M0 is a quotient of R ⊗V0,
where V0 is a ﬁnite-dimensional graded vector space. By the Hilbert
basis theorem, the kernel M1 of the map φ0 : R ⊗V0 →M is ﬁnitely
generated, so is a quotient of R⊗V1 for some ﬁnite-dimensional graded
space V1, and the kernel M2 of φ1 : R ⊗V1 →M1 is ﬁnitely generated,
and so on. The long exact sequences of Ext groups associated to the
short exact sequences
0 →Mj+1 →R ⊗Vj →Mj →0
and Proposition 12.4 then imply by induction in j that Exti(Mj, N) = 0
for any R-module N if i > n −j. In particular, the module Mn is
projective, hence free by Lemma 12.3, i.e., we may take Vn such that
Mn = R ⊗Vn. This gives a free resolution of M by ﬁnitely generated
graded R-modules:
0 →R ⊗Vn →... →R ⊗V0 →M.
66

[PAGE 67]
Thus, taking graded Euler characteristic we obtain
Theorem 12.5. (Hilbert syzygies theorem) We have
H(M, q) =
p(q)
(1 −q)n,
where p is a polynomial with integer coeﬃcients.
Proof. Indeed, p is just the alternating sum of the Hilbert polynomials
of Vj.
□
12.6. The Hilbert-Samuel polynomial. Let R be a commutative
Noetherian ring and m ⊂R a maximal ideal.
Then R/m = k is
a ﬁeld and mN/mN+1 is a ﬁnite-dimensional k-vector space.
Thus
gr(R) := ⊕N≥0mN/mN+1 (where m0 := R) is a graded algebra gen-
erated in degree 1. So by the Theorem 12.5, the Hilbert series
H(gr(R), q) =
X
N≥0
dimk(mN/mN+1)qN
is a rational function of the form
p(q)
(1−q)m, where p is a polynomial and
m = dimk(m/m2). Hence
PR,m(N) :=
N−1
X
j=0
dimk(mj/mj+1) = length(R/mN)
is a polynomial in N for large enough N called the Hilbert-Samuel
polynomial of R at m. The degree of this polynomial equals the order
of the pole of H(gr(R), q) at q = 1. We call this degree the dimension
of R at m, denoted dimm R. For example, if R = k[x1, ..., xn] and m is
any maximal ideal then PR,m(N) =
 N+n−1
n

, so dimm R = n.
Lemma 12.6. Let f ∈m. Then dimm(R/f) ≥dimm R −1.
Proof. The ideal (f) in R/mN is the image of fR/mN−1. So we have
PR/f,m(N) = length((R/mN)/f) ≥length(R/mN) −length(R/mN−1)
= PR,m(N) −PR,m(N −1),
which implies the statement.
□
Let k be an algebraically closed ﬁeld and mp ⊂k[x1, ..., xn] be the
maximal ideal corresponding to p ∈kn.
Corollary 12.7. Let f1, ..., fm ∈k[x1, ..., xn] be homogeneous polyno-
mials of positive degrees. Let Z be an irreducible component of the zero
set Z(f1, ..., fm) ⊂kn. Then dimm0 k[Z] ≥n −m.
67

[PAGE 68]
Proof. Let p ∈Z be not contained in other components of Z(f1, ..., fm).
Applying Lemma 12.6 repeatedly, we get dimmp k[Z] ≥n −m. But
gr(k[Z]/mN
p ) (the associated graded under the ﬁltration induced by
the grading on k[Z]) is a quotient of k[Z]/mN
0 . Thus17
dimm0 k[Z] ≥dimmp k[Z],
so dimm0 k[Z] ≥n −m.
□
12.7. Regular sequences. Let R be a commutative ring. A sequence
f1, ..., fn ∈R is called a regular sequence if for each j ∈[1, n], fj is
not a zero divisor in R/(f1, ..., fj−1), and R/(f1, ..., fn) ̸= 0.
Lemma 12.8. If f1, ..., fn ∈R is a regular sequence then the complex
KR(f1, ..., fn) is exact in negative degrees.
Proof. The proof is by induction in n with obvious base. For the in-
duction step, note that by the inductive assumption KR(f1, ..., fn−1) is
exact in negative degrees with H0 = R/(f1, ..., fn−1), so the cohomol-
ogy of KR(f1, ..., fn) coincides with the cohomology KR/(f1,...,fn−1)(fn),
which vanishes in negative degrees since fn is not a zero divisor in
R/(f1, ..., fn−1).
□
Now let k be an algebraically closed ﬁeld.
Proposition 12.9. Suppose f1, ..., fn ∈R := k[x1, ..., xn] are homoge-
neous polynomials of positive degree such that the zero set Z(f1, ..., fn)
consists of the origin. Then f1, ..., fn is a regular sequence.
Proof. We need to show that for each m ≤n −1, fm+1 is not a zero
divisor in Rm := k[x1, ..., xn]/(f1, ..., fm). Let Zm = Z(f1, ..., fm). It
suﬃces to show that fm+1 does not vanish on any irreducible component
of Zm. Assume the contrary, i.e., that it vanishes on such a component
Z0
m. By Corollary 12.7, we have dimm0 k[Z0
m] ≥n −m. Since fm+1 = 0
on Z0
m, using Lemma 12.6 repeatedly, we get
dimm0 k[Z0
m]/(fm+1, ..., fn) ≥1,
which is a contradiction, as the zero set of fm+1, ..., fn on Z0
m consists
just of the origin, so this dimension must be zero.
□
Proposition 12.10. Suppose f1, .., fn ∈R := k[x1, ..., xn] are homoge-
neous polynomials of degrees d1, ..., dn > 0 such that R is a ﬁnitely gen-
erated module over S := k[f1, ..., fn]. Then this module is free of rank

Proof. By Lemma 12.3, it suﬃces to show that R is a free S-module.
By assumption R0 is ﬁnite-dimensional, i.e., the equations
f1 = ... = fn = 0
have only the zero solution.
By Proposition 12.9, this implies that
f1, ..., fn is a regular sequence, so by Lemma 12.8 the Koszul complex
KR(f1, ..., fn) associated to this sequence is exact in negative degrees.
Now, write S as k[a1, ..., an] with deg aj = 0 and consider the complex
KR⊗S(f1 −a1, ..., fn −an).
This complex is ﬁltered by degree with
associated graded being
KR⊗S(f1, ..., fn) = KR(f1, ..., fn) ⊗S.
Thus KR⊗S(f1 −a1, ..., fn −an) is also exact in nonzero degrees with
H0 = k[x1, ..., xn, a1, ..., an]/(f1 −a1, ..., fn −an) = R.
and the associated graded under the above ﬁltration is gr(R) = R0 ⊗S
as an S-module. This module is free over S, hence so is R.
□
Remark 12.11. Let f1, ..., fr be a regular sequence of homogeneous
polynomials in k[x1, ..., xn] of positive degree and Zm ⊂kn be the zero
set of f1, ..., fm. Then fm+1 is not a zero divisor in k[x1, ..., xn]/(f1, ..., fm),
hence does not vanish identically on any irreducible component of Zm.
So by induction in m we get that the dimension of every irreducible
component of Zm is ≤n −m. By Corollary 12.7, this implies that this
dimension is precisely n−m; in particular, r ≤n, and every irreducible
component of the aﬃne scheme Z := Speck[x1, ..., xn]/(f1, ..., fr) has
dimension n −r. Such a scheme is called a complete intersection.
In fact, it follows by induction in r that Z is a complete intersection
precisely when all its irreducible components have dimension ≤n −r
(in which case they have dimension exactly n −r). In particular, if
r = n, this means that the only k-point of Z is the origin, as indicated
in Proposition 12.9. Thus the converse of this proposition also holds.
12.8. Proof of the CST Theorem, Part II. We are now ready to
prove Theorem 12.2. It follows from Proposition 12.10, Lemma 12.1
and Theorem 10.6 that C[V ] is a free C[V ]G-module. Since C[V ] =
⊕ρHomG(ρ, C[V ])⊗ρ, it follows by Lemma 12.3(ii) that HomG(ρ, C[V ])
69

[PAGE 70]
is also a free C[V ]G-module (as it is graded and projective). Finally,
the rank of this module equals
dimC(V )G(C(V )G ⊗C[V ]G HomG(ρ, C[V ])) = dimC(V )G HomG(ρ, C(V )),
which equals dim ρ by basic Galois theory (C(V ) is a regular represen-
tation of G over C(V )G).

13. Kostant’s theorem
13.1. Kostant’s theorem for Sg. Let g be a semisimple complex Lie
algebra.
Theorem 13.1. (Kostant) Sg is a free (Sg)g-module. Moreover, for
every ﬁnite-dimensional irreducible representation V of g, the space
Homg(V, Sg) is a free (Sg)g module of rank dim V [0], the dimension of
the zero weight space of V .
The rest of the subsection is dedicated to the proof of this theorem.
Introduce a ﬁltration on Sg by setting deg(gα) = 1 for all roots α and
deg h = 2. Then gr(Sg) = Sn−⊗Sh ⊗Sn+ and by the Chevalley
restriction theorem, gr(Sg)g is identiﬁed with the subalgebra (Sh)W
of the middle factor. Thus by the Chevalley-Shephard-Todd theorem,
gr(Sg) is a free gr(Sg)g-module. It follows that Sg is a free (Sg)g-
module (namely, any lift of a homogeneous basis of the graded module
is a basis of the ﬁltered module).
Now recall that
(11)
Sg = ⊕V ∈Irr(g)V ⊗Homg(V, Sg).
Thus Homg(V, Sg) is a graded direct summand in Sg. It follows that
Homg(V, Sg) is a projective, hence free (Sg)g-module (using Lemma
12.3(ii)).
It remains to prove the formula for the rank of Homg(V, Sg). To this
end, consider the Q-graded Hilbert series of Sg, i.e., the generating
function of the characters of symmetric powers of g:
HQ(Sg, q) :=
X
m≥0
(
X
µ∈Q
dim Smg[µ]eµ)qm ∈C[Q][[q]].
Since Sg = Sh ⊗N
α∈R Sgα, we have
HQ(Sg, q) =
1
(1 −q)r
Y
α∈R
1
1 −qeα,
where r = rank(g). On the other hand, by (11),
HQ(Sg, q) =
X
V ∈Irr(g)
H(Homg(V, Sg), q)χV ,
where χV is the character of V .
Now, by the Chevalley restriction theorem (Sg)g ∼= (Sh)W, so
H(Homg(V, Sg), q) = H(Homg(V, (Sg)0), q)H((Sh)W, q).
71

[PAGE 72]
Thus by the Chevalley-Shephard-Todd theorem,
H(Homg(V, Sg), q) = H(Homg(V, (Sg)0), q)

So we get

V ∈Irr(g)
H(Homg(V, (Sg)0), q)χV =

α∈R(1 −qeα).
By character orthogonality, H(Homg(V, (Sg)0), q) is the inner product

H(Homg(V, (Sg)0), q) =

Recall that the inner product on C[P] making the characters orthonor-
mal is given by the formula
(φ, ψ) =

|W|CT(φψ∗Y
α∈R
(1 −eα)),
where where CT denotes the constant term and ∗is the automorphism
of C[P] given by (eµ)∗= e−µ. Thus, using that χ∗
V = χV ∗, we get

H(Homg(V, (Sg)0), q) =

In this formula q is a formal parameter, but the right hand side con-
verges to an analytic function in the disk |q| < 1, since it can be written
as an integral:

18Note however that Fq(x) does not go to 1 pointwise (hence not in C(h/Q∨))
since Fq(0) = 0.

Proof. If x ∈R, |x| ≤1 then minq∈[0,1](1 −2qx + q2) is 1 if x ≤0 and
1 −x2 if x > 0. So if z = x + iy is on the unit circle and 0 ≤q < 1

By Lemma 13.2 we may take the limit q →1 under the integral in
(13). Then, using that Qr

dim Homg(V, (Sg)0) =
Z
h/Q∨χV ∗(eix)dx =
CT(χV ∗) = dim V ∗[0] = dim V [0],
which concludes the proof of Kostant’s theorem.
13.2. The structure of Sg as a (Sg)g-module. As a by-product, we

13.3. The structure of U(g) as a Z(g)-module. Recall that the
universal enveloping algebra U(g) of any Lie algebra g has the standard
ﬁltration deﬁned on generators by deg(g) = 1, which is called the
Poincar´e-Birkhoﬀ-Witt ﬁltration.
Let g be a semisimple complex Lie algebra of rank r, and W be the
Weyl group of g with degrees di, i = 1, ..., r.
Theorem 13.5. (Kostant) (i) The center Z(g) = U(g)g of U(g) is a
polynomial algebra in r generators Ci of Poincar´e-Birkhoﬀ-Witt ﬁltra-
tion degrees di.
(ii) U(g) is a free module over Z(g), and for every irreducible ﬁnite-
dimensional representation V of g, the space Homg(V, U(g)) is a free
Z(g)-module of rank dim V [0].
Proof. By the Poincar´e-Birkhoﬀ-Witt theorem, for any Lie algebra g
we have gr(U(g)) = Sg. Moreover, we have the symmetrization map
Sg →U(g) given by
a1 ⊗... ⊗an 7→1
n!
X
s∈Sn
as(1)...as(n),
ai ∈g, which is an isomorphism of g-modules. Using this map, any
homogeneous element of (Sg)g can be lifted into U(g)g. It follows that
gr(U(g)g) = (Sg)g. Thus Theorem 13.1 implies all the statements of
the theorem.
□
Example 13.6. Suppose g is simple.
Then d1 = 2 and C1 is the
quadratic Casimir of g.

[PAGE 75]
Exercise 13.7. Consider the Lie algebra g = sln(C) spanned by ele-
mentary matrices Eij with Pn

where j is viewed as an element of Z/k.
Hint: It is slightly more convenient (and equivalent) to consider
g = gln(C), in which case one also has the generator C0. Identify g
with g∗using the trace pairing on g. Let Tk : g⊗k →C be the g-module
map deﬁned by Tk(a1 ⊗... ⊗ak) := Tr(ak...a1). Let T ∗
k : C →g⊗k be
the dual map. Show that
T ∗
k (1) =
n
X
i1,...,ik=1
Ei1i2 ⊗Ei2i3 ⊗... ⊗Eiki1.
Use that this element is g-invariant to show that the element Ck−1 is
central.

happens for so2n?

14. Harish-Chandra isomorphism, maximal quotients
14.1. The Harish-Chandra isomorphism. Let g be a complex semisim-
ple Lie algebra. Fix a triangular decomposition g = n−⊕h ⊕n+. By
the PBW theorem, we then have a linear isomorphism
µ : U(n−) ⊗U(h) ⊗U(n+) →U(g)
given by multiplication. We also have the linear map
β : U(n−) ⊗U(h) ⊗U(n+) →U(h)
given by
a−⊗h ⊗a+ 7→ε(a−)ε(a+)h, a± ∈U(n±), h ∈U(h),
where ε : U(n±) →C is the augmentation homomorphism (the counit).
Thus we get a linear map
HC := β ◦µ−1 : U(g) →U(h) = Sh = C[h∗]
called the Harish-Chandra map.
Theorem 14.1. (Harish-Chandra) (i) If b ∈U(g) and c ∈Z(g) then
HC(bc) = HC(b)HC(c). In particular, the restriction of HC to Z(g)
is an algebra homomorphism.
(ii) Deﬁne the shifted action of W on h∗by w•x := w(x+ρ)−ρ where
ρ is the half sum of positive roots (or, equivalently, sum of fundamental
weights). Then HC maps Z(g) into the space of invariants C[h∗]W•.
That is, for any b ∈Z(g) we have HC(b)(λ) = fb(λ + ρ) for some
fb ∈C[h∗]W.
(iii) If V be a highest weight representation of g with highest weight
λ then
fb(λ + ρ) = (v∗
λ, bvλ)
where vλ is a highest weight vector of V and v∗
λ the lowest weight vector
of V ∗such that (v∗
λ, vλ) = 1. Thus if b ∈Z(g) then HC(b)(λ) is the
scalar by which b acts on a highest weight module with highest weight
λ.
(iv) The map HC : Z(g) →C[h∗]W• is a ﬁltered algebra homomor-
phism and gr(HC) = Res, the Chevalley restriction homomorphism
(Sg)g →(Sh)W.
(v) HC is an algebra isomorphism.
The isomorphism HC : Z(g) →C[h∗]W• is called the Harish-
Chandra isomorphism.
Proof. Let b = a−ha+ ∈U(g). We have
(v∗
λ, bvλ) = (v∗
λ, a−ha+vλ) = ε(a−)ε(a+)λ(h) = HC(b)(λ).
76

[PAGE 77]
Thus
HC(bc)(λ) = (v∗
λ, bcvλ) = (v∗
λ, bvλ)(v∗
λ, cvλ) = HC(b)(λ)HC(c)(λ)
since c is central; namely, the last factor is just the eigenvalue of c on
V . This proves (i).
To establish (ii),(iii), it remains to show that for b ∈Z(g), HC(b)
is invariant under the shifted action of all w ∈W. To this end, it
suﬃces to show this for w = si, a simple reﬂection. For this purpose,
consider the Verma module Mλ with (λ + ρ, α∨
i ) = n ∈Z>0. Then
f n
i vλ generates a copy of Mλ−nαi = Msi•λ inside Mλ.
Thus we get
HC(b)(λ) = HC(b)(si • λ). Since this holds on a Zariski dense set, it
holds identically, which yields (ii),(iii).
(iv) follows immediately from (iii).
Finally, (v) follows from (iv) and the Chevalley restriction theorem,
since any ﬁltered map whose associated graded is an isomorphism is
itself an isomorphism.
□
Remark 14.2. Kostant theorems and the Harish-Chandra isomor-
phism extend trivially to reductive Lie algebras.
14.2. Maximal quotients. Let g be a semisimple Lie algebra and M
a g-module on which the center Z(g) acts by a character
χ : Z(g) →C
(for example, M is irreducible). In view of the Harish-Chandra isomor-
phism theorem, we have χ = χλ, where
χλ(z) = HC(z)(λ)
for a unique λ ∈h∗modulo the shifted action of W. As mentioned in
Subsection 7.2, the element χλ is called the inﬁnitesimal character
or central character of M.
If M is a g-bimodule then it carries two actions of Z(g), by left and
by right multiplication. If these actions are by characters, then they
are called the left and right inﬁnitesimal characters of M. The
inﬁnitesimal character of M is then the pair (θ, χ) where θ is the left
inﬁnitesimal character and χ the right inﬁnitesimal character of M.
For a character χ : Z(g) →C let
Uχ = Uχ(g) := U(g)/(z −χ(z), z ∈Z(g)).
This algebra is called the maximal quotient of U(g) with inﬁnitesimal
character χ, as every U(g)-module with such inﬁnitesimal character
factors through Uχ. Note that Uχ is a g-bimodule with inﬁnitesimal
character (χ, χ) (as it is a Uχ-bimodule).
Theorem 13.5 immediately implies
77

[PAGE 78]
Corollary 14.3. For any ﬁnite-dimensional irreducible g-module V we
have dim Homg(V, Uχ) = dim V [0], where g acts on Uχ by the adjoint
action. Thus Uχ is a Harish-Chandra g-bimodule.
Corollary 14.4. If V is a ﬁnite-dimensional g-bimodule then V ⊗Uχ
is a Harish-Chandra g-bimodule.
Proof. This follows from Corollary 14.3 and Exercise 5.12.
□
Corollary 14.5. (i) Every irreducible g-bimodule M locally ﬁnite un-
der the adjoint g-action is a quotient of V ⊗Uχ for some ﬁnite-dimensional
irreducible g-module V with trivial right action of g, where χ is the right
inﬁnitesimal character of M.
(ii) Every irreducible g-bimodule locally ﬁnite under the adjoint g-
action is a Harish-Chandra bimodule.
Proof. (ii) follows from (i) and Corollary 14.4, so it suﬃces to prove (i).
By Dixmier’s lemma (Lemma 7.2), M has some inﬁnitesimal character
(θ, χ). Let V ⊂M be an irreducible ﬁnite-dimensional subrepresenta-
tion under gad. Let us view V ∗as a g-bimodule with action
(af)(x) = −f(ax), fb = 0
for a, b ∈g, x ∈V, f ∈V ∗, and consider the tensor product V ∗⊗M,
which is a g-bimodule with action
a ◦(f ⊗m) := af ⊗m + f ⊗am, (f ⊗m) ◦b := f ⊗mb.
The canonical element u ∈V ∗⊗V ⊂V ∗⊗M is gad-invariant (i.e., com-
mutes with g). Thus we have a bimodule homomorphism ψ : U(g) →
V ∗⊗M given by ψ(c) := uc = P v∗
i ⊗vic, where vi is a basis of V and v∗
i
the dual basis of V ∗. Moreover, since the right inﬁnitesimal character of
M is χ, this homomorphism descends to ψ : Uχ →V ∗⊗M. This gives
rise to a nonzero homomorphism of bimodules ξ : V ⊗Uχ →M, where
the right g-module structure of V is trivial. Since M is irreducible, ξ
is surjective. Thus the result follows from Corollary 14.4.
□

[PAGE 79]
15. Category O of g-modules - I
15.1. Category O. Let g be a semisimple complex Lie algebra.
Deﬁnition 15.1. The category O = Og is the full subcategory of g-
mod, which consists of ﬁnitely generated g-modules M with weight
decomposition and P(M) ⊂∪m
i=1(λi −Q+), where λ1, ..., λm ∈h∗.
It is clear that O is closed under taking subquotients and direct
sums, so it is an abelian category (recall that a submodule of a ﬁnitely
generated g-module is ﬁnitely generated since U(g) is Noetherian).
Also it is easy to see that any nonzero object M ∈O has a singular
vector (namely, take any nonzero vector of a maximal weight in P(M)).
Thus the simple objects (=modules) of O are Lλ, λ ∈h∗.
Example 15.2. All highest weight g-modules, in particular a Verma
module Mλ and its simple quotient Lλ belong to O. Another example
is M
∗
−λ, the restricted dual to the lowest weight Verma module M −λ,
introduced in Exercise 8.13(ii). This module is called the contragre-
dient Verma module and denoted M ∨
λ .
Lemma 15.3. If M ∈O then the weight subspaces of M are ﬁnite-
dimensional.
Proof. Let v1, .., vm be generators of M which are eigenvectors of h (they
exist since M is ﬁnitely generated and has weight decomposition). Let
E := Pm
i=1 U(h ⊕n+)vi = Pm
i=1 U(n+)vi. Then E is ﬁnite-dimensional
by the condition on the weights of M. On the other hand, the natural
map U(n−) ⊗E →M is surjective.
The lemma follows, as weight
subspaces of U(n−) ⊗E are ﬁnite-dimensional.
□
Let R be the ring of series F := P
µ∈h∗cµeµ, where cµ ∈Z and the
set P(F) of µ with cµ ̸= 0 is contained in a ﬁnite union of sets of the
form λ −Q+, λ ∈h∗. If M is an h-semisimple g-module with ﬁnite-
dimensional weight spaces and weights in a ﬁnite union of sets λ −Q+
then we can deﬁne the character of M,
ch(M) =
X
λ∈h∗
dim M[λ]eλ ∈R.
For example,
ch(Mλ) =
eλ
Q
α∈R+(1 −e−α).
We have ch(M ⊗N) = ch(M)ch(N) and
ch(M) = ch(L) + ch(N)
79

[PAGE 80]
when 0 →L →M →N →0 is a short exact sequence. Lemma 15.3
implies that we can deﬁne such characters ch(M) for M ∈O.
Corollary 15.4. The action of Z(g) on every M ∈O factors through
a ﬁnite-dimensional quotient.
Proof. Since Z(g) is ﬁnitely generated, it suﬃces to show that every
z ∈Z(g) satisﬁes a polynomial equation F(z) = 0 in M. Let µ1, ..., µk
be weights such that M is generated by E := M[µ1] ⊕... ⊕M[µk]. By
Lemma 15.3, this space is ﬁnite-dimensional, and it is preserved by z.
Let F be the minimal polynomial of z on E. Then F(z) = 0 on E,
hence on the whole M (as z is central and E generates M).
□
Exercise 15.5. Show that the action of Z(g) on any Harish-Chandra
(g, K)-module factors through a ﬁnite-dimensional quotient. (Mimic
the proof of Corollary 15.4).
Exercise 15.6. (i) Show that for any µ ∈h∗, Ext1
O(Mµ, Mµ) = 0.
(ii) Show that Ext1(Mµ, Mµ) (Ext in the category of all g-modules)
is nonzero.
Corollary 15.7. (i) Any M ∈O has a canonical decomposition
M = ⊕χ∈h∗/WM(χ),
where M(χ) is the generalized eigenspace of Z(g) in M with eigenvalue
χ, and this direct sum is ﬁnite. In other words,
O = ⊕χ∈h∗/WOχ,
where Oχ is the subcategory of O of modules where every z ∈Z(g) acts
with generalized eigenvalue χ(z).
(ii) Each M ∈Oχ has a ﬁnite ﬁltration with successive quotients
having inﬁnitesimal character χ.
Proof. (i) Let R := Z(g)/Ann(M) be the quotient of Z(g) by its an-
nihilator in M.
This algebra is ﬁnite-dimensional, so has the form
R = Qm
i=1 Ri, where Ri are local with units ei, corresponding to
the generalized eigenvalues χ1, ..., χm ∈h∗/W of Z(g) on M.
So
M = ⊕m
i=1M(χi), where M(χi) := eiM.
(ii) If M ∈Oχ then the algebra R is local. Let m be its unique
maximal ideal. Then the required ﬁnite ﬁltration on M is
M ⊃mM ⊃m2M...
□
Thus the simple objects of Oχ are Lµ−ρ, where χ = χµ, i.e., µ ∈χ.
80

[PAGE 81]
We can partition the W-orbit χ into equivalence classes according to
the relation µ ∼ν if µ −ν ∈Q. It is clear that this partition deﬁnes
a decomposition Oχ = ⊕SOχ(S), where S runs over the equivalence
classes in χ under the relation ∼. Namely, Oχ(S) is the subcategory
of modules with all weights in µ −ρ + Q, where µ ∈S.
Example 15.8. Suppose that λ ∈h∗is such that wλ −λ /∈Q for any
1 ̸= w ∈W. In this case the equivalence relation on Wλ is trivial,
so for any µ ∈Wλ the category Oχλ(µ) has a unique simple object
Mµ−ρ. It thus follows from Exercise 15.6 for any µ ∈Wλ, the category
Oχλ(µ) is equivalent to the category of ﬁnite-dimensional vector spaces
(as Mµ−ρ has no nontrivial self-extensions), and the category Oχλ is
semisimple with |W| simple objects.
Lemma 15.9. Every object of O has ﬁnite length.
Proof. By Corollary 15.7 we may assume that M has inﬁnitesimal char-
acter χλ. We may also assume that P(M) ⊂µ + Q for some µ ∈h∗.
Recall that the quadratic Casimir C of g acts on M in the same way as
in Mλ−ρ, i.e., by the scalar λ2 −ρ2. Suppose that v is a singular vector
in a nonzero subquotient M ′ of M of some weight γ ∈µ + Q (it must
exist since weights of M ′ belong to a ﬁnite union of λi −Q+). Then
Cv = (γ2 −ρ2)v, so we must have
γ2 = λ2.
Since the inner product on Q is positive deﬁnite, this equation has a
ﬁnite set S of solutions γ ∈µ + Q.
For a semisimple h-module Y set Y [S] := ⊕γ∈SY [γ]. It follows that
M ′[S] ̸= 0.
Also by Lemma 15.3 we have dim M[S] < ∞.
Thus
length(M) ≤dim M ′[S] ≤dim M[S] is ﬁnite, as claimed.
□
15.2. Partial orders of h∗. Introduce a partial order on h∗: we say
that µ ≤λ if λ −µ ∈Q+ and µ < λ if µ ≤λ but µ ̸= λ. We write
λ ≥µ if µ ≤λ and λ > µ if µ > λ.
If µ = sαλ for some α ∈R+ and µ < λ (i.e., (λ, α∨) ∈Z≥1 and
µ = λ−(λ, α∨)α), then we write µ <α λ. We write µ ⪯λ if there exist
sequences α1, ..., αm ∈R+ and µ = µ0, µ1, ..., µm = λ such that for all
i, µi−1 <αi µi, and write µ ≺λ if µ ⪯λ but µ ̸= λ (i.e., m ̸= 0). We
write λ ⪰µ if µ ⪯λ and λ ≻µ if µ ≺λ.
Remark 15.10. It is easy to see that if µ ≺λ then µ < λ and
µ ∈Wλ, but the converse is false, in general. For example, consider
the root system of type A3, and let us realize h∗as C4/Cdiagonal. Let
µ = (0, 3, 1, 2), λ = (1, 2, 3, 0).
Then µ ∈Wλ and µ < λ, since
λ −µ = (1, −1, 2, −2) = α1 + 2α3. However, µ ⊀λ. Indeed, otherwise
81

[PAGE 82]
there would exist α ∈R+ such that µ ≤sαλ < λ, and it is easy to
check that there is no such α.
15.3. Verma’s theorem.
Theorem 15.11. (D. N. Verma) Let λ, µ ∈h∗and µ ⪯λ. Then
dim Hom(Mµ−ρ, Mλ−ρ) = 1 and Mµ−ρ can be uniquely realized as a
submodule of Mλ−ρ. In particular, Lµ−ρ occurs in the composition se-
ries of Mλ−ρ.
Proof. By Exercise 8.14, dim Hom(Mµ−ρ, Mλ−ρ) ≤1 and any nonzero
homomorphism Mµ−ρ →Mλ−ρ is injective, so it suﬃces to show that
dim Hom(Mµ−ρ, Mλ−ρ) ≥1. By deﬁnition of the partial order ⪯, it
suﬃces to do so when µ <α λ for some α ∈R+, i.e., when µ = sαλ =
λ −nα where n := (λ, α∨) ∈Z+. For generic λ with (λ, α∨) = n ∈Z+,
this follows from the Shapovalov determinant formula (Exercise 8.15),
and the general case follows by taking the limit.
□
We will see below that the converse to Verma’s theorem also holds:
if Lµ−ρ occurs in the composition series of Mλ−ρ then µ ⪯λ. This was
proved by J. Bernstein, I. Gelfand and S. Gelfand, see Theorem 20.13
below.
15.4. The stabilizer in W of a point in h∗/Q. Let x ∈h∗/Q and
Wx ⊂W be the stabilizer of x.
Proposition 15.12. Wx is generated by the reﬂections sα ∈Wx.
Moreover, the roots α such that sα ∈Wx form a root system Rx ⊂R,
and Wx is the Weyl group of Rx. The corresponding dual root system
R∨
x is a root subsystem of R∨, i.e., R∨
x = spanZ(R∨
x) ∩R∨.
Proof. Let T := h∗/Q. The ring C[T/W] := C[T]W is freely generated
by the orbit sums mi = P
β∈Wω∨
i eβ, where ω∨
i are the fundamental
coweights. Hence T/W is smooth (in fact, an aﬃne space). It follows
by the Chevalley-Shephard-Todd theorem that for each x ∈T the
stabilizer Wx is generated by a subset of reﬂections of W. Moreover,
if sα, sβ ∈Wx then sαsβsα = ssα(β) ∈Wx, which implies that the set
Rx of α such that sα ∈Wx is a root system in R, and Wx is its Weyl
group. Moreover, picking a preimage ex of x in h∗, we see that α ∈Rx
if and only if (α∨, ex) ∈Z. Thus R∨
x is a root subsystem of R∨.
□
Remark 15.13. 1. Note that unlike the case x ∈h∗, for x ∈h∗/Q the
group Wx is not necessarily a parabolic subgroup of W, i.e., it is not
necessarily conjugate to a subgroup generated by simple reﬂections. In
fact, the Dynkin diagram of Rx or R∨
x may not be a subdiagram of
82

[PAGE 83]
the Dynkin diagram of W. Such subgroups are called quasiparabolic
subgroups.
For example, if R is of type B2 with simple roots α1 = (1, 0) and
α2 = (−1, 1) then for x = (1
2, 0), Rx is the root system of type A1 × A1
consisting of ±α1 and ±(α1 + α2). The same example shows that Rx
is not necessarily a root subsystem of R, as α1 + (α1 + α2) /∈Rx.
2.
If G∨is the simply connected complex semisimple Lie group
corresponding to R∨then T is the maximal torus of G∨, and it is
easy to see that R∨
x is the root system of the centralizer zx of x in
g∨:= Lie(G∨).

16. Category O of g-modules - II
16.1. Dominant weights. Let us say that a weight λ ∈h∗is dom-
inant for the partial order ≤(respectively, ⪯) if it is maximal with
respect to this order in its equivalence class (or, equivalently, in its
W-orbit).
Corollary 16.1. The following conditions on a weight λ ∈h∗are
equivalent:
(i) λ is dominant for ≤;
(ii) λ is dominant for ⪯;
(iii) For every root α ∈R+, (λ, α∨) /∈Z<0.
(iv) For every w ∈Wλ+Q, wλ ⪯λ.
(v) For every w ∈Wλ+Q, wλ ≤λ.
Proof. It is clear that (iv) implies (v) implies (i) implies (ii). It is also
easy to see that (ii) implies (iii), since if (λ, α∨) ∈Z<0 then sαλ ∼λ
and sαλ > λ so λ is not maximal under ⪯in its equivalence class. It
remains to show that (iii) implies (iv). By Proposition 15.12, Wλ+Q is
the Weyl group of some root system R′ ⊂R, and the equivalence class
S of λ is simply the orbit Wλ+Qλ. By our assumption, for α ∈R′
+ we
have (λ, α∨) ∈Z\Z<0 = Z≥0. Thus, λ = λ′ +ν where λ′ is a dominant
integral weight for R′ (meaning that (λ, α∨) ∈Z≥0 for α ∈R′
+) and
(ν, α∨) = 0 for all α ∈R′
+. Now for any w ∈Wλ+Q, ﬁx a reduced
decomposition w = sim...si1, where si = sβi and βi are the simple
roots of R′. Let λk := sik...si1λ, so λ0 = λ and λm = wλ. Setting
λ′
k := sik...si1λ′ = λk −ν, we then have
λk−1 −λk = λ′
k−1 −λ′
k = (λ′
k−1, β∨
ik)βik = (λ′, si1...sik−1β∨
ik)βik.
The coroot si1...sik−1β∨
ik is positive, so we get that λk ⪯λk−1, which
yields (iv).
□
Corollary 16.1 shows that every equivalence class of weights contains
a unique maximal element with respect to each of the orders ⪯and ≤,
namely the unique dominant weight in this class. The same is true for
minimal elements by changing signs.
16.2. Projective objects. Let C be an abelian category over a ﬁeld
k. Recall that C is said to be Noetherian if any ascending chain of
subobjects of any object X ∈C stabilizes. This holds, for instance,
when objects of C have ﬁnite length.
Recall also that an object P ∈C is projective if the functor Hom(P, −)
is (right) exact, and that C is said to have enough projectives if ev-
ery object L ∈C is a quotient of a projective object P. Note that if
84

[PAGE 85]
objects of C have ﬁnite length then it is suﬃcient for this to hold for
every simple L, then the property can be proved for all L by induction
in length. Indeed, suppose we have a short exact sequence
0 →L1 →L →L2 →0
with L1, L2 ̸= 0 and projectives P1, P2 with epimorphisms pj : Pj ↠Lj.
Then the map p2 lifts to ep2 : P2 →L, which yields an epimorphism
p1 + ep2 : P1 ⊕P2 ↠L.
Suppose that Hom spaces in C are ﬁnite-dimensional. Then by the
Krull-Schmidt theorem, every object of C has a unique representa-
tion as a ﬁnite direct sum of indecomposable ones (up to isomorphism
and permutation of summands).
Proposition 16.2. Let C be a Noetherian abelian category with enough
projectives and ﬁnite-dimensional Hom spaces over an algebraically
closed ﬁeld k. Then
(i) Let I be the set labeling the isomorphism classes of indecomposable
projectives Pi of C. Then the isomorphism classes of simple objects Li
of C are labeled by the same set I, and dim Hom(Pi, Lj) = δij, i, j ∈I.
(ii) For M ∈C of ﬁnite length, the multiplicities [M : Li] equal
dim Hom(Pi, M).
Proof. Let P ∈C be an indecomposable projective. Then End(P) has
no idempotents other than 0, 1, so End(P) = k ⊕N where N is the
nilradical, i.e., it is a local algebra.
Suppose Q ⊂P is a maximal proper subobject (it exists by Zorn’s
lemma since C is Noetherian). Let Q′ ⊂P be a subobject not contained
in Q. Then Q + Q′ = P. So we have an epimorphism Q ⊕Q′ →P,
which, by the projectivity of P, gives a surjection
Hom(P, Q) ⊕Hom(P, Q′) →End(P).
So we have 1P = a + a′, where a, a′ : P →P factor through Q, Q′.
Thus a is not an isomorphism (since Q is proper). As End(P) is local,
it follows that a′ is an isomorphism, so Q′ = P.
It follows that P has a unique maximal proper subobject J(P), and
LP := P/J(P) is simple. Moreover, if L := P/Q is simple then Q =
J(P), so L = LP. So if I′ labels the isomorphism classes of simples in
C, then we get a map ℓ: I →I′ such that ℓ(P) = LP, and we have
dim Hom(Pi, Li′) = δℓ(i),i′. Moreover, ℓis surjective since every simple L
is a quotient of some projective P which may be chosen indecomposable
(if P ↠L and P = ⊕N
i=1Pi where Pi are indecomposable then there
exists i such that the map Pi →L is nonzero, hence an epimorphism
as L is simple).
85

[PAGE 86]
It remains to show that ℓis injective, i.e., if Lm ∼= Ln then Pm ∼= Pn.
To this end, note that the epimorphisms a0 : Pm ↠Ln, b0 : Pn ↠Lm
lift to morphisms a : Pm →Pn, b : Pn →Pm, such that ab ∈
End(Pn) and ba ∈End(Pm) are not nilpotent (as they deﬁne iso-
morphisms on the corresponding simple quotients). Since the algebras
End(Pn), End(Pm) are local, it follows that ab and ba are isomorphisms,
as claimed.
This proves (i).
Part (ii) now follows from the exactness of the
functor Hom(Pi, ?).
□
The object Pi is called the projective cover of Li, and Li is called
the head of Pi; by Proposition 16.2, it is the unique simple quotient
of Pi.
Remark 16.3. In general, objects of a category satisfying the assump-
tions of Proposition 16.2 need not have ﬁnite length. An example when
they can have inﬁnite length is the category of ﬁnitely generated Z-
graded C[x]-modules, where deg(x) = 1. The simple objects in this
category are 1-dimensional modules Ln, n ∈Z, which sit in degree n
(with x acting by zero). The projective cover of Ln is Pn = C[x]n,
the free rank 1 module sitting in degrees n, n + 1, ..., which has inﬁnite
length.
16.3. Projective objects in O.
Proposition 16.4. If λ is dominant then Mλ−ρ is a projective object
in O.19
Proof. Our job is to show that the functor Hom(Mλ−ρ, •) is exact on
O. It suﬃces to show this on Oχλ(S), where S is the equivalence class
of λ. To this end, note that all weights of any X ∈Oχλ(S) are not
> λ −ρ. Thus every v ∈X[λ −ρ] is singular, so there is a unique
homomorphism Mλ−ρ →X sending vλ−ρ to v. It follows that that
Hom(Mλ−ρ, X) ∼= X[λ −ρ], which implies the statement.
□
Now let V be a ﬁnite-dimensional g-module. Then we have an exact
functor V ⊗: O →O.
Corollary 16.5. (i) If P ∈O is projective then so is V ⊗P.
(ii) If λ ∈h∗is dominant then the object V ⊗Mλ−ρ ∈O is projective.
Proof. (i) For X ∈O
Homg(V ⊗P, X) = Homg(P, V ∗⊗X),
19Note that this does not mean that Mλ is a projective U(g)-module; in fact, it
is not.
86

[PAGE 87]
which is exact since P is projective.
(ii) follows from (i) and Proposition 16.4.
□
Corollary 16.6. (i) For every µ ∈h∗, there exists dominant λ ∈h∗
and a ﬁnite-dimensional g-module V such that Hom(V ⊗Mλ−ρ, Lµ) ̸= 0.
Thus O has enough projectives.
(ii) Every projective object P of O is a free U(n−)-module.
Proof. (i) We have
Hom(V ⊗Mλ−ρ, Lµ) = Homg(Mλ−ρ, V ∗⊗Lµ).
Now take V = V ∗= LNρ for large N and λ = µ + (N + 1)ρ. It is clear
that λ is dominant, and Homg(Mλ−ρ, V ∗⊗Lµ) = C, as claimed.
(ii) This follows by Lemma 12.3 since every indecomposable projec-
tive object P ∈O is an h∗-graded direct summand in V ⊗Mλ−ρ, which
is a free graded U(n−)-module.
□
It follows that every simple object Lλ of O has a projective cover Pλ,
with dim Hom(Pλ, Lµ) = δλµ.

17. The nilpotent cone of g
17.1. The nilpotent cone. Let (Sg)0 be the quotient of Sg by the
ideal generated by the positive degree part of (Sg)g, i.e. by the free
homogeneous generators p1, ..., pr of (Sg)g (which exist by Kostant’s
theorem). The scheme
N := Spec(Sg)0 ⊂g∗∼= g
is called the nilpotent cone of g. It follows from the Kostant theo-
rem that p1, ..., pr is a regular sequence, i.e., this scheme is a complete
intersection of codimension r in g (see Remark 12.11), i.e., of dimension
dim N = dim g −r = |R| = 2|R±| = 2 dim n±,
the number of roots of g.
Let x ∈g be a nilpotent element. Recall that then x is conjugate
to an element y ∈n+ and Ad(t2ρ∨)y →0 as t →0, where ρ∨is the
half-sum of positive coroots of g. Thus pi(x) = pi(y) = 0 and hence
x ∈N(C). On the other hand, if x is not nilpotent then ad(x) is not a
nilpotent operator, so Tr(ad(x)N) ̸= 0 for some N, hence x /∈N(C). It
follows that N(C) is exactly the set of nilpotent elements of g, hence
the term “nilpotent cone”.
For example, for g = sl2 we have r = 1 and
p1(A) = −det A = x2 + yz
for A :=

x
y
z
−x

∈g, so N is the usual quadratic cone in C3 deﬁned
by the equation x2 + yz = 0.
17.2. The principal sl2 subalgebra. The principal sl2 subalgebra
of g is the subalgebra spanned by e := Pr
i=1 ei, f := P
i cifi and
h := [e, f] = P
i cihi = 2ρ∨. Thus ci are found from the equations
P
i ciaij = 2 for all j, where A = (aij) is the Cartan matrix of g.
Lemma 17.1. The restriction of the adjoint representation of g to its
principal sl2-subalgebra is isomorphic to L2m1⊕...⊕L2mr for appropriate
mi ∈Z>0.
Proof. Consider the corresponding action of the group SL2(C). The
element −1 ∈SL2(C) acts on g by exp(2πiρ∨) = 1 since ρ∨is an in-
tegral coweight. Thus only even highest weight sl2-modules may occur
in the decomposition of g. Since ρ∨is regular, the 0-weight space of
this module (the centralizer Zg(ρ∨)) is h, i.e., has dimension r. Thus
g has r indecomposable direct summands over the principal sl2, as
claimed.
□
88

[PAGE 89]
The numbers mi (arranged in non-decreasing order) are called the
exponents of g. We will soon see that mi = di −1, where di are the
degrees of g.
17.3. Regular elements. Recall that x ∈g is regular if the dimen-
sion of its centralizer is r = rankg (the smallest it can be). Thus regular
elements form an open set greg ⊂g.
Lemma 17.2. The element e = Pr
i=1 ei is regular.
Proof. By Lemma 17.1, the centralizer Zg(e) is spanned by the highest
vectors of the representations L2m1, ..., L2mr, hence has dimension r.
□
Corollary 17.3. Let B+ be the Borel subgroup of G with Lie algebra
b+ := h ⊕n+. Then Ad(B+)e is the set of elements P
α∈R+ cαeα with
cα ∈C and cαi ̸= 0 for all i.
Proof. Since by Lemma 17.2 dim Zg(e) = r, we have
dim[e, n+] ≥|R+| −r = dim[n+, n+].
Since [e, n+] ⊂[n+, n+], we get that [e, n+] = [n+, n+]. It follows that
if N+ = exp(n+) then Ad(N+)e = e + [n+, n+] is the set of expressions
P
α∈R+ cαeα with cαi = 1 for all i. The statement follows by adding
the action of the maximal torus H = exp(h), which allows to set cαi to
arbitrary nonzero values.
□
17.4. Properties of the nilpotent cone.
Proposition 17.4. The nilpotent cone is reduced.
Proposition 17.4 is proved in the following exercise.
Exercise 17.5. Let g be a ﬁnite-dimensional simple Lie algebra.
(i) Let R0 be the graded algebra in Theorem 12.2. Show that the top
degree of this algebra is D := Pr
i=1(di −1) and R0[D] = C∆, where
∆:= Q
α∈R+ α. Deduce that Pr
i=1(di −1) = |R+|, , the number of
positive roots.
(ii) Let g = ⊕r
i=1L2mi be the decomposition of g as a module over
the principal sl2-subalgebra (e, f, h) given by Lemma 17.1, i.e., mi are
the exponents of g. Show that m1 = 1 and Pr
i=1 mi = |R+|. Moreover,
show that if µg is the partition (mr, ..., m1) then the conjugate partition
µ†
g is (n1, ..., nh−1), where ni is the number of positive roots α of height
i (i.e., (ρ∨, α) = i) and h := mr + 1. Conclude that h = (ρ∨, θ) + 1
where θ is the maximal root, i.e., the Coxeter number of g.
89

[PAGE 90]
(iii)(a) Let bi be the lowest weight vectors of L2mi, and
zf := ⊕r
i=1Cbi ⊂g
be the centralizer of f. Show that g = zf ⊕TeOe, where Oe = Ad(G)e
is the orbit of e. Thus the aﬃne space e + zf is transversal to Oe at e.
This aﬃne space is called the Kostant slice.
(iii)(b) Consider the C×-action on g given by
t ◦x = t

2 ad(h)−1x.
Show that this action preserves the decomposition of (ii), and the linear
coordinates b∗
i on zf have homogeneity degrees mi+1 under this action.
(iv) Let (Sg∗)g = C[p1, ..., pr], deg pi = di, and let epi(y) := pi(e + y),
y ∈zf. Show that epi are polynomials of b∗
j homogeneous under the
C×-action of (iii) of degrees di.
Deduce from this and the identity
P
i(di −1) = P
i mi proved in (i),(ii) that
di −1 = mi
and thus epi = b∗
i (under appropriate choice of basis). Conclude that
the diﬀerentials dpi are linearly independent at e ∈g.
(v) Work out (i)-(iv) explicitly for g = sln.
(vi) Prove Proposition 17.4. Hint: View O(N) as an algebra over
R := Sn+ ⊗Sn−. Use the arguments of Subsection 13.1 to show that it
is a free R-module of rank |W|. Show that the specialization of O(N)
at a generic point z ∈n∗
+ × n∗
−is a semisimple algebra of dimension
|W| (use (iv)). Now take f ∈O(N) such that f k = 0 for some k, and
deduce that the specialization of f at z is zero. Conclude that f = 0.
Proposition 17.6. (i) The orbit Oe := Ad(G)e is open and dense in
N.
(ii) All regular nilpotent elements in g are conjugate to e.
(iii) N is an irreducible aﬃne variety. Thus (Sg)0 is an integral
domain.
Proof. (i) This follows from Corollary 17.3 and the fact that every
nilpotent element in g can be conjugated into n+.
(ii) The orbit Ox of every regular nilpotent element x has the same
dimension as Oe, so the statement follows from (i). Indeed, since Oe
is open and dense, N \ Oe has smaller dimension than N, hence can’t
contain Ox.
(iii) follows from (i) and Proposition 17.4, since Oe is smooth and
connected (being an orbit of a connected group), hence irreducible.
□
Corollary 17.7. Uχ is an integral domain for all χ.

Exercise 17.8. Let e be a nilpotent element in a semisimple complex
Lie algebra g, and ge be the centralizer of e. Let (, ) be the Killing form
of g.
(i) Show that (e, ge) = 0 (prove that for any x ∈ge, the operator
adeadx is nilpotent).
(ii) Show that there exists h ∈g such that [h, e] = 2e (use that
Im(ade) = ge⊥to deduce that e ∈Im(ade)).
(iii) Show that in (ii), h can be chosen semisimple (consider the

(iv) Show that Ch ⊕ge is a Lie subalgebra of g.
(v) Assume that ge is nilpotent. Show that there is a basis of g in

Lie’s theorem). Deduce that (h, x) = 0 for all x ∈ge.
(vi) Show that if ge is nilpotent then there are h, f ∈g such that
[h, e] = 2e, [e, f] = h and [h, f] = −2f.
In other words, there is

(vii) (Jacobson-Morozov theorem, part I) Show that the conclusion of
(vi) holds for any e (without assuming that ge is nilpotent). (Hint: use
induction in dim g. If ge is not nilpotent, use Jordan decomposition to
ﬁnd a nonzero semisimple element x ∈ge and consider the Lie algebra
gx. Show that g′ := [gx, gx] is semisimple and e ∈g′).
(viii) Show that for given e, h, the homomorphism φ in (vi,vii) is
unique (i.e., f is uniquely determined by e, h).
(ix) (Jacobson-Morozov theorem, part II) Show that for a ﬁxed e,
exp(ge) (the Lie subgroup corresponding to ge) is a closed Lie subgroup
of the adjoint group Gad corresponding to g, and the element h (hence
also f) can be chosen uniquely up to conjugation by exp(ge). (Hint:
Let h′ be another choice of h, and consider the element h′ −h ∈ge.)
(x) Explain why the Jacobson-Morozov theorem extends to reduc-
tive Lie algebras (where by a nilpotent element we mean one that is
nilpotent in any ﬁnite-dimensional representation). Give an elementary
proof of this theorem for g = gln using only linear algebra.
(xi) Show that there are ﬁnitely many conjugacy classes of nilpotent
elements in g, i.e., the nilpotent cone N has ﬁnitely many Gad-orbits.
(Hint: Consider the variety X of homomorphisms φ : sl2 →g and
show that it is a disjoint union of ﬁnitely many closed Gad-orbits. To
this end, show that the tangent space to X at each x ∈X coincides
with the tangent space of the orbit Gx at the same point, using that

18. Maps of ﬁnite type, Duﬂo-Joseph theorem
18.1. Maps of ﬁnite type. Let M, N be g-modules. Let Homﬁn(M, N)
be the space of linear maps from M to N which generate a ﬁnite-
dimensional g-module under the adjoint action a ◦T := [a, T]. The
elements of Homﬁn(M, N) are called linear maps of ﬁnite type. For
example, a module homomorphism is a map of ﬁnite type, as it gener-
ates a trivial 1-dimensional g-module.
Exercise 18.1. Show that any map of ﬁnite type has the form
(f ⊗1) ◦Φ, where f ∈V ∗for some ﬁnite-dimensional g-module V
and Φ : M →V ⊗N is a module homomorphism.
Note that Homﬁn(M, N) is a g-bimodule with bimodule structure
given by
(a, b) ◦T := aT + Tb,
a, b ∈g. Moreover, it is clear that if M has inﬁnitesimal character χ and
N has inﬁnitesimal character θ then Homﬁn(M, N) has inﬁnitesimal
character (θ, χ).
Proposition 18.2. If M, N ∈O then Homﬁn(M, N) is an admissible
g-bimodule.
Proof. We must show that for every simple ﬁnite-dimensional g-module
V , the space
Homg(V, Homﬁn(M, N)) = Homg(V, HomC(M, N))
is ﬁnite-dimensional. Let µ(M, N, V ) be its dimension (a nonnegative
integer or inﬁnity). Since the functor (M, N) 7→HomC(M, N) is exact
in both arguments, for any short exact sequence
0 →M1 →M2 →M3 →0
we have
µ(M2, N, V ) = µ(M1, N, V ) + µ(M3, N, V ),
µ(N, M2, V ) = µ(N, M1, V ) + µ(N, M3, V ).
Thus, since M, N have ﬁnite length, it suﬃces to establish the result
for M, N simple. Then M is a quotient of Mλ and N a submodule of
M ∨
µ for some λ, µ, so HomC(M, N) ⊂HomC(Mλ, M ∨
µ ). But by Exercise
8.13, for any ﬁnite-dimensional g-module V ,
Homg(V, HomC(Mλ, M ∨
µ )) ∼= Homg(V ⊗Mλ, M ∨
µ ) ∼=
Homg(Mλ, V ∗⊗M ∨
µ ) ∼= V ∗[λ −µ].
This implies the statement.

Proposition 18.3. For M, N ∈O and a ﬁnite-dimensional g-module
V we have
Homﬁn(M, V ⊗N) = V ⊗Homﬁn(M, N).
Exercise 18.4. Prove Proposition 18.3.
Proposition 18.5. Let V be a ﬁnite-dimensional g-module. Then for
any λ ∈h∗, we have
dim Homg(Mλ, V ⊗Mλ) = dim V [0].
Thus the multiplicity of V in Homﬁn(Mλ, Mλ) equals dim V [0].
Proof. By Exercise 8.14, the statement holds if Mλ is irreducible, i.e.,
generically. Thus dim Homg(Mλ, V ⊗Mλ) ≥dim V [0], and it remains to
prove the opposite inequality. Let Mµ be the simple Verma submodule
of Mλ. Given Φ : Mλ →V ⊗Mλ, we claim that the restriction of
Φ to Mµ must land in V ⊗Mµ.
Indeed, otherwise we will have a
nonzero (hence injective) homomorphism Mµ →V ⊗(Mλ/Mµ), which
is impossible by growth considerations.
But by Exercise 8.14, the statement holds if λ is replaced by µ. So
if it does not hold for λ then there is a nonzero Φ which kills Mµ.
Thus Φ deﬁnes a nonzero homomorphism Mλ/Mµ →Mλ ⊗V , which
is impossible since Mλ ⊗V is a free, hence torsion free U(n−)-module,
while every homogeneous vector in Mλ/Mµ is torsion (as this module
does not contain free U(n−)-submodules by growth considerations).
This establishes the proposition.
□
Remark 18.6. Note that Proposition 18.5 does not extend to maps
Mλ+ν →V ⊗Mλ where ν ∈P is nonzero.
Namely, if Mλ is irre-
ducible then we have dim Homg(Mλ+ν, V ⊗Mλ) = dim V [ν], so in gen-
eral dim Homg(Mλ+ν, V ⊗Mλ) ≥dim V [ν], and the inequality can, in
fact, be strict. The simplest example is g = sl2, V = C, λ = 0, ν = −2,
in which case the left hand side is 1 and the right hand side is 0.
Also the expectation value map
⟨, ⟩: Homg(Mλ, V ⊗Mλ) →V [0]
need not be an isomorphism, even though its source and target have
the same dimension. The simplest example is g = sl2, λ = 0, and V is
the adjoint representation. We have
dim Homg(M0, V ⊗M0) = dim Homg(M0, V ⊗M−2) = 1,
so the only (up to scaling) nonzero homomorphism Φ : M0 →V ⊗M0
in fact lands in V ⊗M−2 ⊂V ⊗M0. Thus ⟨Φ⟩= 0.

18.2. The Duﬂo-Joseph theorem.
Proposition 18.7. The action homomorphism
φ : Uχλ+ρ →Homﬁn(Mλ, Mλ)
is injective.
Proof. Let Mµ ⊂Mλ be a simple Verma submodule with highest weight
vector v. Let Bµ,β : U(n+)[β] ⊗U(n−)[−β] →C be the pairing deﬁned
by the equality
abv = Bµ,β(a, b)v.
As Mµ is simple, this pairing is nondegenerate.
Consider the multiplication map
ξ : U(n−) ⊗U(n+) →Uχλ+ρ.
We claim that the map φ ◦ξ is injective, hence so are ξ and φ|Imξ.
Indeed, let x ∈U(n−) ⊗U(n+) be a nonzero element. We can uniquely
write x = P
α∈Q+ xα, where xα ∈U(n−) ⊗U(n+)[α]. Let β ∈Q+ be a
minimal element such that xβ = P
i bi ⊗ai ̸= 0, where {ai} is a basis
of U(n+)[β]. Let {a∗
i } be the dual basis of U(n−)[−β] with respect to
Bµ,β. Then
(φ ◦ξ)(x)a∗
jv = bjv.
Since bj are not all zero, there exists j such that bjv ̸= 0. It follows
that (φ ◦ξ)(x) ̸= 0, as claimed.
Thus, denoting the PBW ﬁltration by Fn, we have
dim Fn(Uχλ+ρ/Kerφ) ≥dim Fn(U(n−) ⊗U(n+)) ≥Cndim g−r
for some C > 0.
On the other hand, assume that Kerφ ̸= 0 and
consider the nonzero ideal
gr(Kerφ) ⊂(Sg)0 = O(N).
This ideal contains a principal ideal O(N)f, where f ∈O(N) is a
nonzero homogeneous element. Since O(N) is a domain (Proposition
17.6(iii)), this ideal is a free O(N)-module generated by f.
dim Fn(Uχλ+ρ/Kerφ) = dim gr≤n(O(N)/gr(Kerφ))
≤dim gr≤n(O(N)/O(N)f) ≤C′ndim g−r−1.
for some C′ > 0. So we get that Cndim g−r ≤C′ndim g−r−1. This is a
contradiction, so Kerφ = 0 and thus φ is injective.
□
Corollary 18.8. (The Duﬂo-Joseph theorem) φ is an isomorphism.

[PAGE 95]
Proof. Consider the restriction φV of φ to the V ∗-isotypic component.
Thus
φV : Homg(V ∗, (Uχλ+ρ)ad) →Homg(Mλ, V ⊗Mλ).
By Kostant’s theorem, the source of this map has dimension dim V [0],
while by Proposition 18.5, so does the target. Since by Proposition 18.7
φV is injective, it follows that φV is an isomorphism for all V , hence so
is φ.
□
Corollary 18.9. If V is a ﬁnite-dimensional g-module then the natural
map V ⊗Uχλ+ρ →Homﬁn(Mλ, V ⊗Mλ) is an isomorphism.
Proof. This follows from Proposition 18.3 and Corollary 18.8.

18.3. inﬁnitesimal characters of Harish-Chandra bimodules.
Corollary 18.10. Let V be a ﬁnite-dimensional g-module and λ ∈h∗.
(i) The left inﬁnitesimal characters occurring in V ⊗Uχλ are χλ+ν
where ν runs over weights of V .
(ii) If M is a g-module with inﬁnitesimal character χλ then the inﬁn-
itesimal characters occurring in V ⊗M are among χλ+ν where ν runs
over weights of V .
(iii) If M is a nonzero Harish-Chandra g-bimodule with inﬁnitesimal
character (χλ, χµ) then there is w ∈W such that wλ −µ ∈P.
Proof. (i) This follows from Corollary 18.9.
(ii) follows from (i) and the isomorphism
V ⊗M ∼= (V ⊗Uχλ) ⊗Uχλ M.
(iii) This follows from (i) since by Corollary 14.5 any irreducible
Harish-Chandra bimodule is a quotient of V ⊗Uχµ for some µ, V .
□
Let HCθ,χ(g) be the category of Harish-Chandra g-bimodules with
generalized inﬁnitesimal character (θ, χ).
Corollary 18.11. The category of Harish-Chandra g-bimodules HC(g)
has a decomposition according to generalized inﬁnitesimal characters:
HC(g) = ⊕γ,λHCχλ+γ,χλ(g),
where γ ∈P+ and λ ∈h∗/Stab(γ) (here Stab(γ) is the stabilizer of γ
in W). In particular, if (θ, χ) cannot be written as (χλ+γ, χλ), λ ∈h∗,
γ ∈P+, then HCθ,χ(g) = 0.
Proof. This follows from Exercise 15.5 and Corollary 18.10.

19. Principal series representations
19.1. Residual ﬁniteness of U(g).
Proposition 19.1. The homomorphism φ : U(g) →Q
λ∈P+ End(Lλ)
is injective.
Proof. Let x ∈Kerφ, and G be the simply connected group with Lie
algebra g. Then by the Peter-Weyl theorem, x acts by zero on O(G) :=
⊕λ∈P+Lλ ⊗L∗
λ (where x acts only on the ﬁrst component). This means
that the right-invariant diﬀerential operator on G deﬁned by x is zero,
i.e., x = 0.
□
Exercise 19.2. Give another proof of Proposition 19.1 which does not
use the Peter-Weyl theorem. Take x ∈Kerφ.
(i) Show by interpolation that x acts by zero in every Verma module
Mλ.
(ii) Show that if x ∈U(g) acts by zero in Mλ for all λ then x = 0.
Note that Proposition 19.1 implies that any z ∈U(g) which acts by
a scalar in all Lλ belongs to Z(g). Indeed, in this case for any x ∈U(g),
[x, z] acts by zero in Lλ, hence [x, z] = 0.
19.2. Principal series. Let λ, µ ∈h∗, λ −µ ∈P. Deﬁne the princi-
pal series bimodule
M(λ, µ) := Homﬁn(Mλ−ρ, M ∨
µ−ρ) ∈HCχµ,χλ(g).
Then we have
(15)
M(λ, µ) = ⊕V ∈irr(g)V ⊗V ∗[λ −µ].
The bimodule M(λ, µ) represents a certain functor that has a nice
independent description.
Proposition 19.3. Let X ∈HC(g). Then
Homg−bimod(X, M(λ, µ)) ∼= Hom(b−,b+)−bimod(X ⊗Cλ−ρ, Cµ−ρ).
where the (b−, b+)-bimodule structure on Cµ−ρ is deﬁned by the char-
acter (µ −ρ, 0) and on Cλ−ρ by the character (0, λ −ρ).
Proof. We have
Homg−bimod(X, M(λ, µ)) = Homg−bimod(X ⊗Mλ−ρ, M ∨
µ−ρ),
where the right copy of g acts trivially on M ∨
µ−ρ and the left copy of g
acts trivially on Mλ−ρ. Frobenius reciprocity then yields
Homg−bimod(X, M(λ, µ)) = Hom(b+,g)−bimod(X ⊗Cλ−ρ, M ∨
µ−ρ).
96

[PAGE 97]
Since X ⊗Cλ−ρ is diagonalizable under the adjoint action of h, on
the right hand side we may replace M ∨
µ−ρ with its completion c
M ∨
µ−ρ
(the Cartesian product of all weight spaces). Then applying Frobenius
reciprocity again, we get the desired statement.
□
Let us give an explicit realization of M(λ, µ). By (15), M(λ, µ) is
spanned by elements Φv,ℓ: Mλ−ρ →M ∨
µ−ρ, v ∈V, ℓ∈V ∗[λ −µ], where
Φv,ℓu := (v ⊗1, Φℓu),
and Φℓ: Mλ−ρ →V ∗⊗M ∨
µ−ρ is the homomorphism for which ⟨Φℓ⟩= ℓ,
for ﬁnite-dimensional g-modules V .
Moreover these elements easily
express in terms of such elements for simple V . Thus for any V and
y ∈V ⊗V ∗[0] we can deﬁne the linear map ΦV (y) : Mλ−ρ →M ∨
µ−ρ
which depends linearly on y with ΦV (v ⊗ℓ) = Φv,ℓ, and every element
of M(λ, µ) is of this form.
Proposition 19.4. The right action of g on M(λ, µ) is given by the
formula
ΦV (v ⊗ℓ) · b = Φg⊗V ([b ⊗v]
O
[(λ −ρ) ⊗ℓ+

Proof. Consider the homomorphism
Ψℓ:=
X
i
b∗
i ⊗Φℓbi : Mλ−ρ →g∗⊗V ∗⊗M ∨
µ−ρ,
where {bi} is a basis of g and {b∗
i } the dual basis of g∗. We have
⟨Ψℓ⟩=
X
b∗
i ⊗⟨Φℓbi⟩∈g∗⊗V ∗,
where the expectation value map ⟨, ⟩is deﬁned in Exercise 8.13. But
⟨Φℓh⟩= (λ −ρ, h)ℓ, ⟨Φℓeα⟩= 0, ⟨Φℓfα⟩= fαℓ
for α ∈R+. Thus we get
⟨Ψℓ⟩= (λ −ρ) ⊗ℓ+
X
α∈R+
f ∗
α ⊗fαℓ,
hence
Ψℓ= Φ(λ−ρ)⊗ℓ+P
α∈R+ f∗α⊗fαℓ.
This implies the statement since
(ΦV (v ⊗ℓ) · b)u = (v ⊗1, Φℓbu) = (b ⊗v ⊗1, Ψℓu), u ∈Mλ−ρ.

This leads to a geometric construction of the principal series. Namely,
let G be the simply connected group with Lie algebra g, B = B+ be
the Borel subgroup of G whose Lie algebra is b+ and H = B/[B, B]
the corresponding torus.
Fix λ, µ ∈h∗with λ −µ ∈P.
Deﬁne a
real-analytic character
ψλ,µ : H →C×
by
ψλ,µ(x) := λ(x)µ(x∗)−1,
where x∗is the image of x under the compact antiholomorphic invo-
lution σ : H →H (i.e., such that Hσ = Hc, the compact real form of
H). For example, for G = SL2, λ, µ are complex numbers with λ −µ
an integer and x∗= x−1, so
ψλ,µ(x) = xλxµ = xλ−µ|x|2µ.
Deﬁne C∞
λ,µ(G/B) to be the space of smooth functions on G satisfying
F(gb) = F(g)ψλ,µ(b).
This is naturally an admissible representation of G: we have G/B =
Gc/Hc, so the multiplicity space of V in C∞
λ,µ(G/B) is V ∗[λ−µ]; namely,
C∞
λ,µ(G/B)ﬁn = C∞
λ−µ(Gc/Hc)ﬁn, the space of Gc-ﬁnite functions on Gc
(under left translations) such that
F(gx) = F(g)λ(x)µ(x)−1
for x ∈Hc.
Proposition 19.5. We have an isomorphism
ξ : M(λ, µ) →C∞
λ−ρ,µ−ρ(G/B)ﬁn
as Harish-Chandra bimodules. Namely, ξ(Φv,ℓ) is the matrix coeﬃcient
ψv,ℓ(g) := (v, gℓ), g ∈Gc.
Exercise 19.6. Prove Proposition 19.5. Hint: Use Proposition 19.4
to show that ξ is a well deﬁned isomorphism of gad-modules, and after
applying ξ the right action of g looks like
(ψ · b)(g) = (λ −ρ)(Ad(g)b)ψ(g) +

f ∗
α(Ad(g)b)(R(fα)ψ)(g),

Proposition 19.7. The functor Hλ exact when λ is dominant.

20. BGG reciprocity and BGG Theorem
20.1. A vanishing lemma for Ext groups.
Lemma 20.1. Let X ∈O be a free U(n−)-module.
Then for any
µ ∈h∗we have
Exti
O(X, M ∨
µ ) = 0, i > 0.
Proof. Fix a projective resolution P• of X in O and consider the com-
plex Homg(P•, M ∨
µ ) which computes the desired Ext groups. Since Pi
have a weight decomposition,
Homg(P•, M ∨
µ ) = Homg(P•, c
M ∨
µ ),
where c
M ∨
µ := Q
β∈h∗M ∨
µ [β] is the completion of M ∨
µ . We have
c
M ∨
µ = Coindg
b−(Cµ) := Homb−(U(g), Cµ) ∼= HomC(U(n+), Cµ).
Thus, Frobenius reciprocity yields
Homg(P•, c
M ∨
µ ) = Homb−(P•, Cµ).
By Proposition 16.6(ii), Pi are free U(n−)-modules, so the exact se-
quence of U(n−)-modules
... →P1 →P0 →X →0
is split. Thus the complex Homb−(P•, Cµ) is exact in positive degrees,
which implies the statement.

20.2. Standard ﬁltrations. A standard (or Verma) ﬁltration on
X ∈O is a ﬁltration for which successive quotients are Verma modules.
X is called standardly ﬁltered if it admits a standard ﬁltration. It
is clear that every standardly ﬁltered object X is necessarily a free
U(n−)-module.
Corollary 20.2. If X is standardly ﬁltered then Exti
O(X, M ∨
µ ) = 0 for
all µ ∈h∗and i > 0.
Proof. This follows from Lemma 20.1.
□
The converse also holds. In fact, we have
Theorem 20.3. X is standardly ﬁltered if and only if

λ ) = 0
for all λ ∈h∗.

Proof. Let E be a ﬁnite-dimensional vector space, and suppose we have
a short exact sequence in O:
0 →K →E ⊗Mλ →Z →0
with K[λ] = 0.
Lemma 20.4. If Ext1
O(Z, M ∨
µ ) = 0 for all µ ∈h∗then K = 0 and
Z ∼= E ⊗Mλ.
Proof. The long exact sequence of cohomology yields
... →Hom(E ⊗Mλ, M ∨
µ ) →Hom(K, M ∨
µ ) →Ext1
O(Z, M ∨
µ ) = 0.
For λ ̸= µ, we have Hom(Mλ, M ∨
µ ) = 0, so it follows that Hom(K, M ∨
µ ) =
0. But we also have Hom(K, M ∨
λ ) = 0, as K[λ] = 0, while every nonzero
submodule of M ∨
λ contains Lλ. It follows that K = 0.
□
Now let us prove the theorem. We only need to prove the “if” di-
rection.
We argue by induction in the length of X (with the base
case X = 0 being trivial). Let λ be a maximal weight in P(X) and
E := X[λ]. Let Z be the submodule of X generated by E; it is a
quotient of E ⊗Mλ by a submodule K with K[λ] = 0. We have a short
exact sequence
0 →Z →X →Y →0.
Thus from the long exact sequence of cohomology we get an exact
sequence
... →Hom(Z, M ∨
µ ) →Ext1
O(Y, M ∨
µ ) →Ext1
O(X, M ∨
µ ) = 0.
It follows that for µ ̸= λ we have Ext1
O(Y, M ∨
µ ) = 0, as in this case
Hom(Z, M ∨
µ ) = 0 (since Z is a quotient of E ⊗Mλ). On the other
hand, if µ = λ then by the argument in the proof of Lemma 20.1 we
have
Ext1
O(Y, M ∨
λ ) = Ext1
C(Y, Cλ),
where C is the category of h-semisimple b−-modules. But Ext1
C(Y, Cλ) =
0, as all weights of Y are not > λ and hence any short exact sequence
of b−-modules
0 →Cλ →eY →Y →0
canonically splits. By the induction assumption, it follows that Y is
standardly ﬁltered, so by Corollary 20.2, Exti(Y, M ∨
µ ) = 0 for all i ≥1,
in particular for i = 1, 2. Thus the long exact sequence of Ext groups
gives
Ext1(Z, M ∨
µ ) = Ext1(X, M ∨
µ ) = 0,
hence Z = E ⊗Mλ by Lemma 20.4. This completes the induction
step.

20.3. BGG reciprocity. Denote by dλµ the multiplicity of Lµ in the

pendent, these numbers are determined from the formula
X
µ
dλµch(Lµ) = ch(Mλ) =
eλ
Q
α∈R+(1 −e−α).
Thus the knowledge of dλµ is equivalent to the knowledge of the char-
acters ch(Lλ).
Since by Corollary 20.5(ii) the projective covers Pλ of Lλ are stan-
dardly ﬁltered, we may also deﬁne the multiplicities d∗
λµ of Mµ in Pλ.
These are independent of the choice of the standard ﬁltration and are
determined by the formula
ch(Pλ) =
X
µ
d∗
λµch(Mµ) =
X

d∗
λµ
eλ
Q
α∈R+(1 −e−α).
Theorem 20.6. (BGG reciprocity) We have d∗
λµ = dµλ.
Proof. We compute dim Hom(Pλ, M ∨
µ ) in two ways.
First using the
standard ﬁltration of Pλ and Lemma 20.1, we have dim Hom(Pλ, M ∨
µ ) =
d∗
λµ. On the other hand, using that the multiplicity of Lλ in M ∨
µ is dµλ,
we get dim Hom(Pλ, M ∨
µ ) = dµλ.
□
Let cλµ = dim Hom(Pλ, Pµ) be the entries of the Cartan matrix C of
O. They are equal to the multiplicities of Lλ in Pµ.
Corollary 20.7. We have
cλµ =
X
ν
dνλdνµ.
In other words, C = DTD where D = (dλµ).
Note that since D is upper triangular with respect to the partial
order ≤with ones on the diagonal, it can be uniquely recovered from
C by Gauss decomposition. Thus the knowledge of D is equivalent to
the knowledge of C.

Example 20.8. Consider the structure of the category Oχ for g =
sl2. The only interesting case is χ = χλ+1 for λ ∈Z≥0. Then the
simple objects are X = Lλ (ﬁnite-dimensional) and Y = M−λ−2. By
Proposition 16.4, the projective cover PX is just the Verma module
Mλ, which has composition series [X, Y ], starting from the head X.
To determine PY , consider the tensor product P := M−1 ⊗Lλ+1. This
is projective with character
ch(P) = ch(Mλ) + ch(Mλ−2) + ... + ch(M−λ−2).
Thus denoting by Πλ the projection functor to the generalized inﬁni-
tesimal character χλ+1, we get that
ch(Πλ(P)) = ch(Mλ) + ch(M−λ−2).
Note that M−λ−2 is not projective since Ext1
O(M−λ−2, Lλ) ̸= 0 (there is
a nontrivial extension M ∨
λ ). Thus Πλ(P) is indecomposable (otherwise
one of the summands in the decomposition would have to be M−λ−2),
i.e., Πλ(P) = PY . Since it maps to Y and receives an injection from
Mλ, its composition series is [Y, X, Y ].
This is the big projective
object of Oχ. We this get for Oχ:
D =

We can now compute the (basic) algebra A whose module category is
equivalent to Oχ. This is the algebra A = End(PX ⊕PY ), and it has
dimension P
i,j cij = 5. The basis is formed by 1X, 1Y and morphisms
a : PX →PY , b : PY →PX and ab : PY →PY . Moreover, we have
ba = 0. Thus the algebra A is the path algebra of the quiver with two
vertices x, y with edges a : x →y and b : y →x with the only relation
ba = 0.
20.4. The duality functor. Let τ : g →g be the Cartan involution
given by τ(ei) = fi, τ(fi) = ei, τ(hi) = −hi. For X ∈O let Xτ be the
module X twisted by τ, and X∨= (Xτ)∗
ﬁn, the h-ﬁnite part of (Xτ)∗.
The following proposition is easy:
Proposition 20.9. (i) X∨∈O and has the same character and com-
position series as X.
(ii) (Mλ)∨= M ∨
λ , L∨
λ = Lλ.
(iii) the assignment X 7→X∨is an involutive equivalence of cate-
gories O →Oop which preserves the decomposition into Oχ(S).

20.5. The Jantzen ﬁltration. It turns out that every Verma mod-
ule Mλ carries a canonical ﬁnite ﬁltration by submodules called the
Jantzen ﬁltration, which plays an important role in studying cat-
egory O.
In fact, this ﬁltration is deﬁned much more generally, as
follows.
Let k be a ﬁeld and V, U be free k[[t]]-modules of the same rank
d < ∞, and let B ∈Hom(V, W) be such that det B := ∧dB is nonzero.
Let V0 := V/tV . Deﬁne Vm ⊂V0 to be the space of all v0 ∈V0 such
that there exists a lift v ∈V of v0 for which Bv ∈tmW. It is clear
that V0 ⊃V1 ⊃V2 ⊃... with V1 = KerB(0), and Vm = 0 for some m.
Thus we get a ﬁnite descending ﬁltration {Vj} of V0 called the Jantzen
ﬁltration attached to B.
Exercise 20.11. (i) Show that there exist unique nonnegative integers
n1 ≤... ≤nd such that for some bases e1, ..., ed of V and f1, ..., fd of
W over k[[t]] one has Bei = tnifi, and that CokerB ∼= ⊕d
i=1(k[t]/tni) as
a k[[t]]-module. Deduce that the order of vanishing of det B at t = 0
equals dimk CokerB = Pd
i=1 ni.
(ii) Suppose dim Vj = dj (so d0 = d). Show that for all j ∈Z≥0,
ni = j if and only if d −dj < i ≤d −dj+1, and deduce the Jantzen
sum formula: the order of vanishing of det B at t = 0 equals P
j≥1 dj.
(iii) Suppose that V, W are modules over some k[[t]]-algebra A with
A0 := A/tA (for example, A = A0[[t]] and V, W are A0-modules), and
B is an A-module homomorphism. Show that the Jantzen ﬁltration of
V0 attached to B is a ﬁltration by A0-submodules.
The Jantzen ﬁltration on Mλ is now deﬁned using the homomorphism
B : Mλ(t) →M ∨
λ(t) over A0 := U(g) corresponding to the Shapovalov
form, where λ(t) := λ + tρ. Namely, we deﬁne it separately on each
weight subspace.
For example, (Mλ)1 = Jλ is the maximal proper
submodule of Mλ.
Exercise 20.12. (Jantzen sum formula for Mλ) Use the Jantzen sum
formula of Exercise 20.11 and the formula for the determinant of the
Shapovalov form (Exercise 8.15) to show that
X
j≥1
ch((Mλ)j) =
X
α∈R+:(λ+ρ,α∨)∈Z≥1
ch(Mλ−(λ+ρ,α∨)α).
20.6. The BGG theorem. The following is the converse to Theorem
15.11.
Theorem 20.13. (Bernstein – I. Gelfand – S. Gelfand) If Lµ−ρ occurs
in the composition series of Mλ−ρ (i.e., dλ−ρ,µ−ρ ̸= 0) then µ ⪯λ.
104

[PAGE 105]
Proof. It is clear that λ −µ ∈Q+. The proof is by induction in the
integer n := (λ −µ, ρ∨). If n = 0, the statement is obvious, so we
only need to justify the induction step for n > 0. Then Lµ−ρ occurs
in Jλ−ρ = (Mλ−ρ)1, the degree 1 part of the Jantzen ﬁltration of Mλ.
Thus by the Jantzen sum formula (Exercise 20.12), Lµ−ρ must occur
in Mλ−ρ−(λ,α∨)α = Msαλ−ρ for some α ∈R+ such that (λ, α∨) ∈Z≥1.
By the induction assumption, we then have µ ⪯sαλ. But sαλ ≺λ, so
we get µ ≺λ.
□
Corollary 20.14. The following conditions on µ ≤λ are equivalent.
(i) µ ⪯λ
(ii) Lµ−ρ occurs in Mλ−ρ.
(iii) dim Hom(Mµ−ρ, Mλ−ρ) ̸= 0.

21. Multiplicities in category O
The multiplicities dλµ are complicated in general, and the (even-
tually successful) attempt to understand them was one of the main
developments that led to creation of geometric representation theory.
These multiplicities are given by the Kazhdan-Lusztig conjecture
(1979) proved by Beilinson-Bernstein and independently by Brylinski-
Kashiwara in 1981. By now several proofs of this conjecture are known,
but they are complicated and beyond the scope of this course. How-
ever, let us give the statement of this result. To simplify the exposition,
we do so for Oχλ when λ ∈P+; it turns out that this case captures all
the complexity of the situation, and the general case is similar.
21.1. The Hecke algebra. Even to formulate the Kazhdan-Lusztig
conjecture, we need to introduce an object which seemingly has nothing
to do with our problem - the Hecke algebra of W. Namely, recall that
W is deﬁned by generators si, i = 1, ..., r subject to the braid relations
sisj... = sjsi..., i ̸= j,
where the length of both words is mij such that aijaji = 4 cos2
π
mij (for
ajiaij = 0, 1, 2, 3, mij = 2, 3, 4, 6), and also the relations s2
i = 1. The
same relations of course deﬁne the group algebra ZW, in which the last
relation can be written as the quadratic relation (si + 1)(si −1) = 0.
The Hecke algebra Hq(W) of W is deﬁned over Z[q
1
2, q−1
2] by the
generators Ti satisfying the same braid relations
TiTj... = TjTi..., i ̸= j,
and the deformed quadratic relations
(Ti + 1)(Ti −q) = 0.
For every w ∈W we can deﬁne the element Tw = Ti1...Tim for
every reduced decomposition w = si1....sim. This is independent on the
reduced decomposition since any two of them can be related by using
only the braid relations. Moreover, it is easy to see that the elements
Tw span Hq(W), since any non-reduced product of Ti can be expressed
via shorter products by using the braid and quadratic relations for Ti.
Moreover, we have
Proposition 21.1. Tw, w ∈W are linearly independent, so they form
a basis of Hq(W). Thus Hq(W) is a free Z[q
1
2, q−1
2]-module of rank
|W|.
106

[PAGE 107]
Proof. Let V be the free Z[q
1
2, q−1
2]-module with basis Xw, w ∈W.
Deﬁne a left action of the free algebra with generators Ti on V by
TiXw = Xsiw
if ℓ(siw) = ℓ(w) + 1 and
TiXw = (q −1)Xw + qXsiw
if ℓ(siw) = ℓ(w)−1. We claim that this action factors through Hq(W).
To show this, deﬁne a right action of the same free algebra on V by
XwTi = Xwsi
if ℓ(wsi) = ℓ(w) + 1 and
XwTi = (q −1)Xw + qXwsi
if ℓ(wsi) = ℓ(w) −1. It is easy to check by a direct computation that
these two actions commute:
(16)
(TiXw)Tj = Ti(XwTj).
Also the elements X1Tw clearly span V . Thus to prove the relations
of Hq(W) for the left action, it suﬃces to check them on X1, which is
straightforward.
Since TwX1 = Xw are linearly independent, it follows that Tw are
linearly independent, as claimed.
□
Exercise 21.2. Check identity (16).
The quadratic relation for Ti implies that it is invertible in the Hecke
algebra, with inverse
T −1
i
= q−1(Ti + 1 −q).
These inverses satisfy the relation (T −1
i
+ 1)(T −1
i
−q−1) = 0 (obtained
by multiplying the quadratic relation for Ti by −T −2
i
q−1), and also the
braid relations.
It follows that the Hecke algebra has an involutive
automorphism D that sends q
1
2 to q−1
2 and each Ti to T −1
i
.
More
generally one has D(Tw) = T −1
w−1.
21.2. The Bruhat order. Recall that the partial Bruhat order on
W is deﬁned as follows: y ≤w if a reduced decomposition of y can be
obtained from a reduced decomposition of w by crossing out some si;
thus y ≤w implies that ℓ(y) ≤ℓ(w), and if the equality holds then
y = w. Moreover, if ℓ(w) = ℓ(y) + 1 then y < w iﬀy = y1y2 and
w = y1siy2 for some i, where ℓ(y) = ℓ(y1) + ℓ(y2). In this case we say
that w covers y, and y ≤w iﬀthere exists a sequence y = x0 < x1 <
... < xm = w such that xj+1 covers xj for all j (here m = ℓ(w) −ℓ(y)).
107

[PAGE 108]
Exercise 21.3. Show that if y ≤w then for any dominant λ ∈P,
wλ ⪯yλ, and the converse holds if λ is regular (i.e., Wλ = 1).
Example 21.4. For type A1 the Bruhat order is the covering relation
1 < s. For type A2 the covering relations are
1 < s1, s2 < s1s2, s2s1 < s1s2s1 = s2s1s2.
21.3. Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials.
Theorem 21.5. There exist unique polynomials Py,w ∈Z[q] such that
(a) Py,w = 0 unless y ≤w, and Pw,w = 1;
(b) If y < w then Py,w has degree at most ℓ(w)−ℓ(y)−1
2
;
(c) The elements
Cw := q−ℓ(w)
2 X
y
Py,w(q)Ty ∈Hq(W)
satisfy D(Cw) = Cw.
Proof. Let y = si1...sil be a reduced decomposition of y. Then we have
T −1
y−1 =
lY
j=1
T −1
ij
= q−ℓ(y)
lY
j=1
(Tij + 1 −q).
Thus there exist unique polynomials Rx,y ∈Z[q] such that
D(Ty) = T −1
y−1 =
X
x
q−ℓ(x)Rx,y(q−1)Tx,
with Rx,y = 0 unless x = y (in which case Rx,y(q) = 1) or ℓ(x) < ℓ(y). It
is easy to check that Rx,y can be computed using the following recursive
rules: for a simple reﬂection s,
Rx,y = Rsx,sy, sx < x, sy < y;
Rx,y = (q −1)Rx,sy + qRsx,sy, sx > x, sy < y.
(we have Rx,1 = δx,1 and for y ̸= 1 there is always i such that siy < y).
This implies by induction in ℓ(y) that Rx,y = 0 unless x ≤y. Indeed, if
x′ := sx < x, y′ := sy < y then Rx,y = Rx′,y′, so if this is nonzero then
by the induction assumption x′ ≤y′, hence sx′ ≤sy′, i.e., x ≤y. On
the other hand, if sx > x, sy < y and Rx,y ̸= 0 then either Rx,sy ̸= 0
or Rsx,sy ̸= 0, hence either x ≤sy or sx ≤sy. But each one of the
inequalities x ≤sy, sx ≤sy implies x ≤y.
We also see by induction that deg Rx,y ≤ℓ(y) −ℓ(x).
Now it is easy to compute that the condition that D(Cw) = Cw is
equivalent to the recursion
q
ℓ(w)−ℓ(x)
2
Px,w(q−1) −q
ℓ(x)−ℓ(w)
2
Px,w(q) =
108

[PAGE 109]
X
x<y
(−1)ℓ(x)+ℓ(y)q
−ℓ(x)+2ℓ(y)−ℓ(w)
2
Rx,y(q−1)Py,w(q).
We can now see that this recursion has a unique solution Px,w with
required properties, as the two terms on the left are supposed to be
polynomials in q
1
2 and q−1
2 without constant terms.
□
The elements Cw form a basis of the Hecke algebra called the Kazhdan-
Lusztig basis, and the polynomials Py,w are called the Kazhdan-
Lusztig polynomials.
21.4. Kazhdan-Lusztig conjecture. The Kazhdan-Lusztig conjec-
ture (now a theorem) is:
Theorem 21.6. (i) Py,w has non-negative coeﬃcients.
(ii) The multiplicity [My•λ : Lw•λ] equals Py,w(1).
The polynomials Py,w have the property that if y ≤w then Py,w(0) =
1, so if in addition ℓ(w) −ℓ(y) ≤2 then Py,w(q) = 1 (indeed, it has to
be a polynomial of degree 0). Also if w = w0 then Py,w = 1 for all y.
Example 21.7. For type A2 (g = sl3) we have the following de-
compositions in the Grothendieck group of Oχλ (where we abbreviate
si1...sik · λ as i1...ik:
M121 = L121
M12 = L12 + L121
M21 = L21 + L121
M1 = L1 + L12 + L21 + L121
M2 = L2 + L12 + L21 + L121
M∅= L∅+ L1 + L2 + L12 + L21 + L121.

g = sl3 for regular weights λ.

22. Projective functors - I
22.1. Projective functors and projective θ-functors. Let Rep(g)f
be the category of g-modules in which the center Z(g) of U(g) acts
through its ﬁnite-dimensional quotient. We have
Rep(g)f = ⊕θ∈h∗/W Rep(g)θ,
where Rep(g)θ is the category of modules with generalized inﬁnitesimal
character θ. Recall that for a ﬁnite-dimensional g-module V we have
an exact functor FV : Rep(g) →Rep(g) given by X 7→V ⊗X (e.g.,
FC = Id), and that if M has inﬁnitesimal character χλ then
FV (M) = (V ⊗Uχλ) ⊗Uχλ M.
Recall also that the inﬁnitesimal characters occurring in the left g-
module V ⊗Uχλ are χλ+β for β ∈P(V ) (Corollary 18.10); thus the
inﬁnitesimal characters occurring in FV (M) belong to the same set. It
follows that
FV (Rep(g)χλ) ⊂⊕β∈P(V ) Rep(g)χλ+β,
hence FV maps Rep(g)f to itself. Finally note that FV ∗is both right
and left adjoint to FV .
Deﬁnition 22.1. A projective functor is an endofunctor of Rep(g)f
which is isomorphic to a direct summand in FV for some V .
Example 22.2. For θ ∈h∗/W let Πθ : Rep(g)f →Rep(g)θ be the
projection. Then Id = ⊕θ∈h∗/WΠθ, hence Πθ is a projective functor.
It is easy to see that projective functors form a category which is
closed under taking compositions, direct summands and ﬁnite direct
sums, and every projective functor admits a left and right adjoint which
are also projective functors (we’ll see that they are isomorphic). It is
also clear that every projective functor F has a decomposition
F = ⊕θ,χ∈h∗/WΠχ ◦F ◦Πθ.
Finally, projective functors obviously map category O to itself and by
Proposition 16.5(i) send projectives of this category to projectives.
For a inﬁnitesimal character θ : Z(g) →C let Rep(g)n
θ ⊂Rep(g)θ
be the subcategory of modules annihilated by (Kerθ)n. In other words,
Rep(g)n
θ is the category of left modules over the algebra
U (n)
θ
:= U(g)/(Kerθ)nU(g).
Every M ∈Rep(g)θ is the nested union of submodules Mn ⊂M of
elements killed by (Kerθ)n, and Mn ∈Rep(g)n
θ. Note that U (1)
θ
= Uθ
and Rep(g)1
θ is the category of modules with inﬁnitesimal character θ.
110

[PAGE 111]
For a projective functor F denote by F(θ) the restriction of F to
Rep(g)1
θ.
Deﬁnition 22.3. A projective θ-functor is a direct summand in
FV (θ).
For example, if F is a projective functor then F(θ) is a projective
θ-functor.
Theorem 22.4. Let F1, F2 be projective θ-functors for θ = χλ. Let
iλ : Hom(F1, F2) →Hom(F1(Mλ−ρ), F2(Mλ−ρ)).
Then iλ is an isomorphism.
Proof. It suﬃces to assume Fj = FVj(θ), j = 1, 2. Let V = V ∗
1 ⊗V2.
Then Hom(F1, F2) = Hom(Id(θ), FV (θ)) and
Hom(F1(Mλ−ρ), F2(Mλ−ρ)) = Homg(Mλ−ρ, V ⊗Mλ−ρ).
Thus it suﬃces to show that the natural map
iλ : Hom(Id(θ), FV (θ)) →Homg(Mλ−ρ, V ⊗Mλ−ρ)
is an isomorphism.
Recall that for associative unital algebras A, B, a right exact functor
F : A −mod →B −mod has the form F(X) = F(A) ⊗A X, where
F(A) is the corresponding (B, A)-bimodule. Thus if F1, F2 are two such
functors then Hom(F1, F2) ∼= Hom(B,A)−bimod(F1(A), F2(A)). Applying
this to A = Uθ and B = U(g), we get
Hom(Id(θ), FV (θ)) = Hom(U(g),Uθ)−bimod(Uθ, V ⊗Uθ) = (V ⊗Uθ)gad.
Moreover, upon this identiﬁcation the map iλ becomes the natural map
iλ : (V ⊗Uχλ)gad →Hom(Mλ−ρ, V ⊗Mλ−ρ)gad.
But this map is an isomorphism by the Duﬂo-Joseph theorem, as it is
obtained by restricting the Duﬂo-Joseph isomorphism
Uχλ ∼= Homﬁn(Mλ−ρ, Mλ−ρ)
to the multiplicity space of V ∗.
□
22.2. Lifting projective θ-functors.
Proposition 22.5. (i) If F1, F2 are projective functors then every mor-
phism φ : F1(θ) →F2(θ) lifts to a morphism bφ : F1|Rep(g)θ →F2|Rep(g)θ.
(ii) If F1 = F2 and φ2 = φ then we can choose bφ so that bφ2 = bφ.
(iii) If φ is an isomorphism then so is bφ.
111

[PAGE 112]
Proof. (i) It suﬃces to show that there exist morphisms
φn : F1|Rep(g)n
θ →F2|Rep(g)n
θ
such that φn restricts to φn−1 and φ1 = φ; then bφ is the projective
limit of φn. As before, we may assume without loss of generality that
F1 = Id and F2 = FV . As explained in the proof of Theorem 22.4, we
have
Hom(F1|Rep(g)n
θ , F2|Rep(g)n
θ ) =
Hom(U(g),U(n)
θ
)−bimod(U (n)
θ , V ⊗U (n)
θ ) = (V ⊗U (n)
θ )gad.
This implies the statement, as the map U (n)
θ
→U (n−1)
θ
is onto and
V ⊗U (n)
θ
is a semisimple gad-module.
(ii) Let F be a direct summand in FV . Let p : FV →FV be the
projection to F. Let A := End(F(θ)) = pEnd(FV (θ))p and φ ∈A. Let
F n(θ) be the restriction of F to Rep(g)n
θ, so that F 1(θ) = F(θ). We
have
An := End(F n(θ)) = pEnd(F n
V (θ))p = p(EndV ⊗U (n)
θ )gadp.
So we have a chain of surjective homomorphisms
... →An →An−1 →... →A1 = A
and our job is to show that φ admits a chain of lifts
... 7→φn 7→φn−1 7→... 7→φ1 = φ
such that φn ∈An and φ2
n = φn.
To this end, note that the kernel I of the surjection An →An−1
satisﬁes I2 = 0, so I is a left and right module over An/I = An−1. So
we can construct the desired chain of lifts by induction in n as follows.
Pick any lift e∗of e0 := φn−1. Then e∗−e2
∗= a ∈I, and e0a = ae0. We
look for an idempotent e in the form e = e∗+ b, b ∈I. The equation
e2 = e is then equivalent to
e0b + be0 −b = a.
Set b = (2e0 −1)a. Then
e0b + be0 −b = 2e0a + (1 −2e0)a = a,
as desired. Now we can set φn = e.
(iii) If φ : F1(θ) →F2(θ) is an isomorphism then it has the inverse
ψ : F2(θ) →F1(θ) such that φ ◦ψ = 1, ψ ◦φ = 1. Let bφ = (φn) be a
lift of φ. Our job is to show that φn are isomorphisms for all n, which
yields (iii). We prove it by induction in n.
The base is trivial, so we just need to do the induction step from n−1
to n. By the induction assumption, φn−1 is invertible with φ−1
n−1 = ψn−1.
112

[PAGE 113]
Let ψn be a lift of ψn−1 and consider the composition ψn ◦φn in the
corresponding algebra An. Let I be the kernel of the map An →An−1.
Then ψn◦φn = 1+a where a ∈I. Since I2 = 0, setting ψ′
n := (1−a)◦ψn,
we get ψ′
n◦φn = 1. Similarly we can construct ψ′′
n such that φn◦ψ′′
n = 1.
Thus ψ′
n = ψ′′
n is the inverse of φn.
This completes the induction
step.

Corollary 22.6. (i) Let F1, F2 be projective functors. Then: any iso-
morphism F1(Mλ−ρ) ∼= F2(Mλ−ρ) lifts to an isomorphism
F1|Rep(g)χλ →F2|Rep(g)χλ;
(ii) Let F be a projective functor. Then any decomposition F(Mλ−ρ) =
⊕iMi can be lifted to a decomposition F = ⊕iFi where Fi are projective
functors and Fi(Mλ−ρ) = Mi;
(iii) Every projective θ-functor is of the form F(θ) for a projective
functor F.
Proof. (i) follows from Proposition 22.5(i),(iii) and Theorem 22.4.
(ii) follows from Proposition 22.5(ii).
To prove (iii), let H be a projective θ-functor, so H ⊕H′ = FV (θ).
Thus H(Mλ−ρ)⊕H′(Mλ−ρ) = FV (Mλ−ρ). So by (ii) there is a projective
functor F with F(θ)(Mλ−ρ) ∼= F(Mλ−ρ) ∼= H(Mλ−ρ). Thus H ∼= F(θ)
by Theorem 22.4.
□
22.3. Decomposition of projective functors.
Proposition 22.7. (i) Each projective functor F is a direct sum of
indecomposable projective functors. Moreover, for F ◦Πθ this sum is
ﬁnite.
(ii) If F = F ◦Πχλ for dominant λ is an indecomposable projective
functor then F(Mλ−ρ) = Pµ−ρ for some µ ∈h∗.
Proof. (i) We have F = ⊕θ∈h∗/WF ◦Πθ, so it suﬃces to show the
statement for F ◦Πθ. Let θ = χλ, and consider F ◦Πθ(Mλ−ρ) ∈O. Let
us write this object as a ﬁnite direct sum of indecomposables, ⊕N
i=1Mi.
Then by Corollary 22.6(ii) we get a decomposition F ◦Πθ = ⊕N
i=1Fi,
and all Fi are indecomposable.
(ii) Since F is indecomposable and Mλ−ρ is projective, F(Mλ−ρ) is
indecomposable and projective, so the statement follows.

23. Projective functors - II
23.1. The Grothendieck group of O. The Grothendieck group K(O)
of O is freely spanned by the classes of simple modules [Lλ−ρ] or, more
conveniently, by the classes of Verma modules [Mλ−ρ], which we’ll de-
note δλ; so it is a basis of K(O). Put an inner product on K(O) by
declaring this basis to be orthonormal. Note that if P is projective
then
([P], [M]) = dim Hom(P, M).
Indeed, in this case dim Hom(P, M) is a linear function of [M], and for
M = Mµ by the BGG reciprocity we have:
dim Hom(Pλ, Mµ) = dµλ = d∗
λµ = (
X
ν
d∗
λνδν+ρ, δµ+ρ) = ([Pλ], [Mµ]).
Since every projective functor F is exact, it deﬁnes an endomorphism
[F] of K(O). For example,
[FV ]δλ =
X
β
mV (β)δλ+β,
where mV (β) is the weight multiplicity of β in V . Clearly [F1 ⊕F2] =
[F1] + [F2] and [F1 ◦F2] = [F1][F2].
Theorem 23.1. (i) If F1, F2 are projective functors with [F1] = [F2]
then F1 ∼= F2.
(ii) If (F, F ∨) are an adjoint pair of projective functors then [F] is
adjoint to [F ∨] under the inner product on K(O).
(iii) For a projective functor F, its left and right adjoint are isomor-
phic.
Proof. (i) By Corollary 22.6, to prove (i), it suﬃces to show that
F1(Mλ−ρ) ∼= F2(Mλ−ρ)
for all dominant λ. These objects are projective, so it is enough to
check that they have the same character (or deﬁne the same element
of K(O)). This implies the claim.
(ii) We need to show that ([F]x, y) = (x, [F ∨]y). It suﬃces to take
x = [P] for projective P and y = [M]. Then, since F(P) is projective,
we have
([F][P], [M]) = ([F(P)], [M]) = dim Hom(F(P), M) =
dim Hom(P, F ∨(M)) = ([P], [F ∨(M)]) = ([P], [F ∨][M]),
as claimed.
(iii) follows from (i),(ii).

23.2. W-invariance. We have an action of the Weyl group W on
K(O) by wδλ := δwλ.
Theorem 23.2. If F is a projective functor then [F] commutes with
W on K(O).
Proof. We may assume that F = Πχ ◦F ◦Πθ for χ, θ ∈h∗/W and F is
indecomposable. Let λ be a dominant weight such that θ = χλ. Deﬁne
S = {µ ∈λ + P : χµ = χ}.
Let us say that λ dominates χ if for every µ ∈S we have λ −µ ∈P+.
Lemma 23.3. When λ dominates χ then
(i) Theorem 23.2 holds;
(ii) For each µ ∈S there exists an indecomposable projective functor
Fµ sending Mλ−ρ to Pµ−ρ.
Proof. (i) For a ﬁnite-dimensional g-module V , let GV := Πχ ◦FV ◦Πθ.
Since the character of V is W-invariant, [FV ] commutes with W, hence
so does [GV ]. Thus its suﬃces to show that [F] is an integer linear
combination of [GV ] for various V .
By Proposition 22.7(ii), F(Mλ−ρ) = Pµ−ρ, where µ ∈S. Let β :=
λ −µ. By our assumption, β ∈P+. Deﬁne n(β) := (β, 2ρ∨), a non-
negative integer. We will prove the required statement by induction in
n(β).
The base of induction is n(β) = 0, hence β = 0 and µ = λ. So
F(Mλ−ρ) = Pλ−ρ = Mλ−ρ. This implies that F = Πθ, so [F] is clearly
commutes with W.
So it remains to justify the induction step. Let L := L∗
β, a ﬁnite-
dimensional g-module. Consider the decomposition of the functor GL
into indecomposables (which we have shown to exist in Proposition
22.7(ii)): GL = ⊕jFνj, where νj ∈S and Fνj(Mλ−ρ) = Pνj−ρ (this
direct sum may contain repetitions). So GL(Mλ−ρ) = ⊕jPνj−ρ. Thus

These two formulas for [GL]δλ jointly imply that νj ≥µ for all j, and
only one of them equals µ, i.e.,
(17)
GL = Fµ ⊕
M
ν∈S,ν>µ
cνµFν
for some constants cνµ ∈Z≥0. But if ν > µ then n(λ −ν) < n(λ −µ),
so by the induction assumption [Fν] for all ν > µ in this sum are linear
combinations of [GV ] for various V . Thus so is Fµ. But F(Mλ−ρ) =
Fµ(Mλ−ρ), so F ∼= Fµ and the induction step follows.
(ii) The functor Fµ from (17) has the desired property.

Now we are ready to prove the theorem in the general case. So λ
no longer needs to dominate χ. However, for suﬃciently large integer
N, the weight λ + Nρ dominates both χ and θ. Let θN := χλ+Nρ.
We have shown in Lemma 23.3(ii) that there exists an indecomposable
projective functor G = Πθ ◦G ◦ΠθN such that G(Mλ+(N−1)ρ) = Pλ−ρ =
Mλ−ρ. Moreover, by Lemma 23.3(i), W commutes with both [G] and
[F ◦G] = [F][G]. Thus for w ∈W,
w[F]δλ = w[F][G]δλ+Nρ = [F][G]wδλ+Nρ = [F]w[G]δλ+Nρ = [F]wδλ = [F]δwλ.
So for u ∈W,
u[F]δwλ = uw[F]δλ = [F]uwδλ = [F]uδwλ,
i.e.,
u[F]δµ = [F]uδµ
for all µ ∈h∗, as claimed.
□
Lemma 23.4. Let λ ∈h∗be dominant and φ, ψ ∈λ+P, ψ ⪯φ. Then
(λ −φ)2 ≤(λ −ψ)2, and if (λ −φ)2 = (λ −ψ)2 then ψ ∈Wλφ.
Proof. Consider the subgroup Wλ+Q ⊂W. By Proposition 15.12, it is
the Weyl group of a root system R′ ⊂R. Let us ﬁrst prove the result
when µ <α λ, α ∈R, i.e., ψ = sαφ, ψ ̸= φ. Then α ∈R′ and thus by
Proposition 16.1
(λ, α∨) = a ∈Z≥1, (φ, α∨) = −(ψ, α∨) = b ∈Z≥0.
We have λ = 1
2aα + λ′, φ = 1
2bα + φ′, ψ = −1
2bα + φ′. where λ′, φ′ are
orthogonal to α. Thus
(λ −ψ)2 −(λ −φ)2 = ((a+b
2 )2 −(a−b
2 )2)α2 = abα2.
So this is ≥0, and if it is zero then either b = 0, in which case φ = ψ
and there is nothing to prove, or a = 0, so sαλ = λ and sα ∈Wλ, as
claimed.
116

[PAGE 117]
Now let us consider the general case. By assumption, there is a chain
ψ = ψm <αm ψm−1... <α1 ψ0 = φ,
where α1, ..., αm are positive roots of R. Thus, as we’ve shown,
(λ −ψi)2 ≤(λ −ψi−1)2
for all i ≥1, so (λ −φ)2 ≤(λ −ψ)2. Moreover, if (λ −φ)2 = (λ −ψ)2
then (λ −ψi−1)2 = (λ −ψi)2 for all i ≥1 so ψi−1 ∈Wλψi, hence
ψ ∈Wλφ.
□
Remark 23.5. The last statement of Lemma 23.4 fails if the partial
order ⪯is replaced with ≤.
For example, take R = A3 and ψ =
(0, 3, 1, 2), φ = (1, 2, 3, 0), as in Remark 15.10 (so ψ < φ but ψ ⊀φ),
and let λ := (1, 1, 0, 0). Then (λ −φ)2 = (λ −ψ)2 = 10, but Wλ =
⟨(12), (34)⟩, so ψ /∈Wλφ.
23.3. Classiﬁcation of indecomposable projective functors. De-
note by Ξ0 the set of pairs (λ, µ) of weights in h∗such that λ −µ ∈P,
and let Ξ := Ξ0/W. So in general an element ξ ∈Ξ can be represented
by more than one pair. Let us say that the pair (µ, λ) representing ξ
is proper if λ is dominant and µ is a minimal element of Wλµ with
respect to the partial order ⪯(where Wλ is the stabilizer of λ in W). It
is clear that any ξ has a proper representative. This representative is
not unique in general, but for every dominant λ in the W-orbit of the
second coordinate of ξ, there is a unique µ such that (µ, λ) is a proper
representation of ξ (indeed, Wλµ has a unique minimal element).
Theorem 23.6. For any ξ ∈Ξ there exists an indecomposable projec-
tive functor Fξ such that Fξ(Mν−ρ) = 0 if χν ̸= χλ and Fξ(Mλ−ρ) =
Pµ−ρ for any proper representation (µ, λ) of ξ. The assignment ξ 7→Fξ
is a bijection between Ξ and the set of isomorphism classes of indecom-
posable projective functors.
Proof. For a projective functor F let
aF(µ, λ) := (δµ, [F]δλ)
be the matrix coeﬃcients of [F]. If λ is dominant then F(Mλ−ρ) is
projective, so aF(µ, λ) ≥0 for all µ ∈h∗. Since by Theorem 23.2 [F]
commutes with W, this holds for all λ ∈h∗.
Let S(F) := {(µ, λ) ∈h∗× h∗: aF(µ, λ) > 0}. Since aF(µ, λ) ≥0,
if F = ⊕iFi then S(F) = ∪iS(Fi). Also it is clear that S(FV ) ⊂Ξ0.
It follows that S(F) ⊂Ξ0 for any F, so for (µ, λ) ∈S(F) we have
λ −µ ∈P.
Let S∗(F) be the set of elements of S(F) for which (λ −µ)2 has
maximal value (it is clear that (λ −µ)2 is bounded on S(F), so S∗(F)
117

[PAGE 118]
is nonempty if F ̸= 0). Since by Theorem 23.2 [F] commutes with W,
both S(F) and S∗(F) are W-invariant.
We claim that if F is indecomposable, then S∗(F) is a single W-
orbit. More speciﬁcally, recall that F = F ◦Πχλ for some dominant λ
and F(Mλ−ρ) = Pµ−ρ for some µ.
Lemma 23.7. In this case S∗(F) = ξ := W(µ, λ) and (µ, λ) is a proper
representation of ξ.
Proof. It suﬃces to check that if (φ, λ) ∈S∗(F) then φ ∈Wλµ and
µ ⪯φ. So let (φ, λ) ∈S∗(F). Since F is indecomposable, χµ = χφ, so
there exists w ∈W such that µ = wφ. Moreover, by Theorem 20.13,
[Pµ−ρ] =
X
µ⪯η
d∗
µηδη,
we get that µ ⪯ψ. Thus we may apply Lemma 23.4 with ψ = µ. It
follows that (λ −φ)2 ≤(λ −µ)2. But by the deﬁnition of S∗(F), we
have (λ −φ)2 ≥(λ −µ)2. Thus (λ −φ)2 = (λ −µ)2. Then Lemma 23.4
implies that φ ∈Wλµ, as claimed.
□
Thus to every indecomposable projective functor F we have assigned
ξ = S∗(F)/W ∈Ξ. If (µ, λ) is a proper representation of ξ then it
follows that F(Mλ−ρ) = Pµ−ρ, so F is completely determined by ξ by
Corollary 22.6. It remains to show that any ξ ∈Ξ is obtained in this
way. To this end, let ξ = W(µ, λ) (a proper representation), and let
V be a ﬁnite-dimensional g-module with extremal weight µ −λ. Then
(µ −λ)2 ≥β2 for any weight β of V , so (µ, λ) ∈S∗(FV ). This implies
that (µ, λ) ∈S∗(F) for some indecomposable direct summand F of FV .
Since S∗(F)/W consists of one element, this F must correspond to the
element ξ.

24. Applications of projective functors - I
24.1. Translation functors. Let θ, χ ∈h∗/W and V be a ﬁnite-
dimensional irreducible g-module. Write Fχ,V,θ for the projective func-
tor Πχ ◦FV ◦Πθ, and let us view it as a functor Rep(g)θ →Rep(g)χ.
Pick dominant weights λ, µ ∈h∗such that θ = χλ, χ = χµ, and
λ −µ ∈P (this can be done if Fχ,V,θ ̸= 0, which we will assume).
Theorem 24.1. If Wλ = Wµ and V has extremal weight µ −λ then
Fχ,V,θ : Rep(g)θ →Rep(g)χ is an equivalence of categories. A quasi-
inverse equivalence is given by the functor Fθ,V ∗,χ.
Proof. It suﬃces to show that
Fχ,V,θ(Mλ−ρ) = Mµ−ρ, Fθ,V ∗,χ(Mµ−ρ) = Mλ−ρ.
Indeed, then
Fθ,V ∗,χ ◦Fχ,V,θ(Mλ−ρ) = Mλ−ρ, Fχ,V,θ ◦Fθ,V ∗,χ(Mµ−ρ) = Mµ−ρ,
so
Fθ,V ∗,χ ◦Fχ,V,θ ∼= IdRep(g)θ, Fχ,V,θ ◦Fθ,V ∗,χ ∼= IdRep(g)χ,
i.e., Fχ,V,θ, Fθ,V ∗,χ are mutually quasi-inverse equivalences.
We only prove the ﬁrst statement, the second one being similar. We
have
Fχ,V,θ(Mλ−ρ) = Πχ(V ⊗Mλ−ρ).
By Corollary 20.5(i), V ⊗Mλ−ρ has a standard ﬁltration whose com-
position factors are Mλ+β−ρ where β is a weight of V . The only ones
among them that survive the application of Πχ are those for which
χλ+β = χµ, i.e., λ + β = wµ for some w ∈W. So wµ ⪯µ (as µ is
dominant). Thus, applying Lemma 23.4 with φ = µ, ψ = wµ, we get
(λ −µ)2 ≤(λ −wµ)2 = β2.
On the other hand, since µ −λ is an extremal weight of V , we have
(λ −µ)2 ≥β2. It follows that (λ −µ)2 = β2 = (λ −wµ)2. Thus by
Lemma 23.4 we may choose w ∈Wλ. But since Wλ ⊂Wµ, it follows
that wµ = µ, so β = µ−λ. Since the weight multiplicity of an extremal
weight is 1, it follows that Fχ,V,θ(Mλ−ρ) = Mµ−ρ, as claimed.
□
Theorem 24.1 shows that for dominant λ the category Rep(g)χλ de-
pends (up to equivalence) only on the coset λ + P and the subgroup
Wλ ⊂W.
In view of Theorem 24.1, the functors Fχ,V,θ are called
translation functors (as they translate between diﬀerent inﬁnitesi-
mal characters).
119

[PAGE 120]
Remark 24.2. Suppose we only have Wλ ⊂Wµ instead of Wλ = Wµ
(with all the other assumptions being the same). Then the proof of
Theorem 24.1 still shows that Fχ,V,θ(Mλ−ρ) = Mµ−ρ. Thus [Fχ,V,θ]δλ =
δµ, and since by Theorem 23.2 [Fχ,V,θ] is W-invariant, it follows that
[Fχ,V,θ]δν = δµ for all ν ∈Wµλ.
On the other hand, we no longer have Fθ,V ∗,χ(Mµ−ρ) = Mλ−ρ, in
general. Namely, the proof of Theorem 24.1 shows that Fθ,V ∗,χ(Mµ−ρ)
has a ﬁltration whose successive quotients are Mν−ρ, ν ∈Wµλ, each oc-
curring with multiplicity 1 (so the length of this ﬁltration is |Wµ/Wλ|).
Thus
[Fθ,V ∗,χ]δµ =
X
ν∈Wµλ
δν.
It follows that
[Fχ,V,θ][Fθ,V ∗,χ]δµ = |Wµ/Wλ|δµ,
hence Fχ,V,θ ◦Fθ,V ∗,χ(Mµ−ρ) = |Wµ/Wλ|Mµ−ρ (as the left hand side is
projective). Thus Fχ,V,θ ◦Fθ,V ∗,χ ∼= |Wµ/Wλ|Id.
Remark 24.3. Let C ⊂Rep(g) be a full subcategory invariant under
all FV and Πθ, and Cθ := ΠθC = C ∩Rep(g)θ. Then Theorem 24.1
implies that if Wλ = Wµ then the functors Fχ,V,θ, Fθ,V ∗,χ are mutually
quasi-inverse equivalences between Cθ and Cχ. Interesting examples of
this include:
1. C = O. In this case we obtain that for dominant λ the category
Oχλ up to equivalence depends only on λ + P and the stabilizer Wλ.
In particular, for regular dominant integral λ all these categories are
equivalent.
2. C is the category of g-modules which are locally ﬁnite and semisim-
ple with respect to a reductive Lie subalgebra k ⊂g.
If k is the
ﬁxed subalgebra of an involution of g, this category contains the cate-
gory of (gR, K)-modules for any connected compact group K such that
LieK = k. Namely, it is just the subcategory of modules that integrate
to K.
24.2. Two-sided ideals in Uθ and submodules of Verma mod-
ules. Let θ = χλ for dominant λ. Let Ωθ denote the lattice of two-
sided ideals in Uθ (i.e., the set of two-sided ideals equipped with the
operations of sum and intersection). Likewise, let Ω(λ) be the lattice
of submodules of Mλ−ρ.
We have a map ν : Ωθ →Ω(λ) given by
ν(J) = JMλ−ρ. It is clear that ν preserves inclusion and arbitrary
sums.
Theorem 24.4. (i) I ⊂J iﬀν(I) ⊂ν(J). In particular, ν is injective.
120

[PAGE 121]
(ii) The image of ν is the set of submodules of Mλ−ρ which are quo-
tients of direct sums of Pµ−ρ where χµ = χλ, µ ⪯λ and µ ⪯Wλµ.
(iii) If λ is regular (i.e., Wλ = 1) then ν is an isomorphism of
lattices.
Proof. (i) Let F be a projective θ-functor, and φ : F →Idθ a morphism
of functors Rep(g)1
θ →Rep(g). Let M(φ, F) be the image of the map
φMλ−ρ : F(Mλ−ρ) →Mλ−ρ and J(φ, F) the image of φUθ : F(Uθ) →Uθ.
Note that φUθ is a morphism of (U(g), Uθ)-bimodules, so J(φ, F) is a
subbimodule of Uθ, i.e., a 2-sided ideal. Let a : Uθ →Mλ−ρ be the
surjection given by a(u) = uvλ−ρ. Then by functoriality of φ
a ◦φUθ = φMλ−ρ ◦a.
Hence
ν(J(φ, F)) = J(φ, F)Mλ−ρ = J(φ, F)vλ−ρ = a(J(φ, F)) =
Im(a ◦φUθ) = Im(φMλ−ρ ◦a) = Im(φMλ−ρ) = M(φ, F).
Let us show that any 2-sided ideal J in Uθ is of the form J(φ, F)
for some F, φ. Since Uθ is Noetherian, J is generated by some ﬁnite-
dimensional subspace V ⊂J which can be chosen gad-invariant. Then
by Frobenius reciprocity the gad-morphism ι : V →Uθ can be lifted
to a morphism of (U(g), Uθ)-bimodules bφ : V ⊗Uθ = FV (Uθ) →Uθ,
i.e., to a functorial morphism φ : FV (θ) →Idθ. It is clear that then
J = J(φ, F).
We are now ready to prove (i), i.e., that M(φ, F) ⊂M(φ′, F ′) implies
J(φ, F) ⊂J(φ′, F ′). Since F(Mλ−ρ), F ′(Mλ−ρ) are projective, the in-
clusion M(φ, F) ,→M(φ′, F ′) lifts to a map eα : F(Mλ−ρ) →F ′(Mλ−ρ),
i.e., φ′
Mλ−ρ ◦eα = φMλ−ρ. But by Theorem 22.4, morphisms of projective
θ-functors are the same as morphisms of the images of Mλ−ρ under
these functors. Thus there is α : F →F ′ which maps to eα and such
that φ′ ◦α = φ. Hence
J(φ, F) = Im(φUθ) ⊂Im(φ′
Uθ) = J(φ′, F ′),
and (i) follows.
(ii) The proof of (i) implies that the image of ν consists exactly of
the submodules M(φ, F). Such a submodule is the image of F(Mλ−ρ)
under a morphism. But F is a projective θ-functor, so by Corollary
22.6(iii), it is of the form eF(θ), where eF is a projective functor. Also
by Theorem 23.6, eF is a direct sum of Fξ, so F(Mλ−ρ) is a direct sum
of Pµ−ρ, where (µ, λ) is a proper representation of ξ.
Thus µ ⪯λ
and µ ⪯Wλµ. Conversely, if for such µ we have a homomorphism
121

[PAGE 122]
γ : Pµ−ρ = Fξ(Mλ−ρ) →Mλ−ρ then γ = φMλ−ρ where φ : Fξ(θ) →Idθ.
So Im(γ) = ν(J(φ, Fξ(θ))). Since ν preserves sums, (ii) follows.
(iii) Every submodule of Mλ−ρ is a quotient of a direct sum of Pµ−ρ
with χµ = χλ, µ ≤λ.
Hence by Proposition 16.1 µ ⪯λ, as λ is
dominant. (This also follows from Theorem 20.13). So if Wλ = 1 then
by (ii) ν is surjective, hence bijective by (i). Since I ∩J is the largest
of all ideals contained both in I and in J and similarly for submodules,
ν also preserves intersections by (i).
Thus ν is an isomorphism of
lattices.
□
Corollary 24.5. Let θ = χλ where λ is dominant. If Mλ−ρ is irre-
ducible then Uθ is a simple algebra. Conversely, if Uθ is simple then
Mµ−ρ is irreducible for all µ with χµ = θ.
Proof. The direct implication follows from Theorem 24.4. For the re-
verse implication, suppose for some distinct µ1, µ2 ∈Wλ, we have
Mµ1−ρ ,→Mµ2−ρ and Mµ1−ρ is simple.
Then in view of the Duﬂo-
Joseph theorem we have an inclusion
J := Homﬁn(Mµ2−ρ, Mµ1−ρ) ,→Homﬁn(Mµ2−ρ, Mµ2−ρ) = Uθ,
and J is a proper 2-sided ideal (as it does not contain 1) which is not
zero (as Mµ1−ρ ∼= M ∨
µ1−ρ and hence for a ﬁnite-dimensional g-module
V , Hom(Mµ2−ρ, V ⊗Mµ1−ρ) ∼= V [µ2 −µ1]).
□
Using the determinant formula for the Shapovalov form, this gives
an explicit description of the locus of θ ∈h∗/W where Uθ is simple.

25. Applications of projective functors - II
25.1. Duﬂo’s theorem on primitive ideals in Uθ. Recall that a
prime ideal in a commutative ring R is a proper ideal I such that
if xy ∈I then x ∈I or y ∈I. This deﬁnition is not good for non-
commutative rings: for example, the zero ideal in the matrix algebra
Matn(C), n ≥2, would not be prime, even though this algebra is
simple; so Matn(C) would have no prime ideals at all. However, the
deﬁnition can be reformulated so that it works well for noncommutative
rings.
Deﬁnition 25.1. A proper 2-sided ideal I in a (possibly non-commutative)
ring R is prime if whenever the product XY of two 2-sided ideals
X, Y ⊂R is contained in I, either X or Y must be contained in I.
Note that for commutative rings this coincides with the usual deﬁni-
tion. Indeed, if I is prime in the noncommutative sense and if xy ∈I
then (x)(y) ⊂I, so (x) ⊂I or (y) ⊂I, i.e. x or y is in I. Conversely,
if I is prime in the commutative sense and X, Y are not contained in
I then there exist x ∈X, y ∈Y not in I, so xy /∈I, i.e., XY is not
contained in I. But in the noncommutative case the two deﬁnitions
diﬀer, e.g. 0 is clearly a prime ideal (in the noncommutative sense) in
any simple algebra, e.g. in the matrix algebra Matn(C).
A ring R is called prime if 0 is a prime ideal in R. For example, if
R is an integral domain then it is prime, and the converse holds if R
is commutative. On the other hand, there are many noncommutative
prime rings which are not domains, e.g. simple rings, such as the matrix
algebras Matn(C), n ≥2. Also it is clear that an ideal I ⊂R is prime
iﬀthe ring R/I is prime (thus every maximal ideal is prime, so prime
ideals always exist). If moreover R/I is a domain, one says that I is
completely prime.
Another important notion is that of a primitive ideal.
Deﬁnition 25.2. An ideal I ⊂R is primitive if it is the annihilator
of a simple R-module M.
It is easy to see that every primitive ideal I is prime: if X, Y are
2-sided ideals in R and XY ⊂I then XY M = 0, so if Y is not
contained in I then Y M ̸= 0. Thus Y M = M (as M is simple), hence
XM = XY M = 0, so X ⊂I. Also for a commutative ring a primitive
ideal is the same thing as a maximal ideal. Indeed, if I is maximal then
R/I is a ﬁeld, so a simple R-module, and I is the annihilator of R/I.
Conversely, if I is primitive and is the annihilator of a simple module
M then M = R/J is a ﬁeld and I = J, so I is maximal.
123

[PAGE 124]
Exercise 25.3. Show that every maximal ideal in a unital ring is
primitive, and give a counterexample to the converse.
We see that in general a prime ideal need not be primitive, e.g. the
zero ideal in C[x]. Nevertheless, for Uθ we have the following remarkable
theorem due to M. Duﬂo:
Theorem 25.4. Every prime ideal J ⊂Uθ is primitive and moreover is
the annihilator of a simple highest weight module Lµ−ρ, where χµ = θ.
Proof. The module M := Mλ−ρ/ν(J) has ﬁnite length, so let us endow
it with a ﬁltration by submodules Fk = FkM with simple successive
quotients L1, ..., Ln (Lk = Fk/Fk−1). Let Ik ⊂Uθ be the annihilators
of Lk. Since JM = 0, we have J ⊂Ik for all k. Also IkFk ⊂Fk−1, so
I1...InM = 0, hence I1...InMλ−ρ ⊂JMλ−ρ. By Theorem 24.1(i), this
implies that I1....In ⊂J. Since J is prime, this means that there exists
m such that Im ⊂J. Then J = Im, i.e. J is the annihilator of Lm.
But Lm = Lµ−ρ for some µ such that χµ = χλ = θ.
□
Note that the choice of µ is not unique, for example, for J = 0 and
generic θ, any of the |W| possible choices of µ is good. In fact, the
proof of Duﬂo’s theorem shows that for every dominant λ such that
θ = χλ, we can choose µ ∈Wλ such that µ ⪯λ.
25.2. Classiﬁcation of simple Harish-Chandra bimodules. De-
note by HCn
θ the category of Harish-Chandra bimodules over g annihi-
lated on the right by the ideal (Kerθ)n. These categories form a nested
sequence; denote the corresponding nested union by HCθ. Recall that
we have a direct sum decomposition HC = ⊕θ∈h∗/WHCθ. This implies
that every simple Harish-Chandra bimodule belongs to HC1
θ for some
inﬁnitesimal character θ.
Recall also that for a ﬁnite-dimensional g-module V , in HC1
θ we have
the object V ⊗Uθ. Moreover, this object is projective: for Y ∈HC1
θ
we have
Hom(V ⊗Uθ, Y ) = Homg−bimod(V ⊗U(g), Y ) = Homgad(V, Y ),
which is an exact functor since Y is a locally ﬁnite (hence semisimple)
gad-module. Finally, since Y is a ﬁnitely generated bimodule locally
ﬁnite under gad, there exists a ﬁnite-dimensional gad-submodule V ⊂Y
that generates Y as a bimodule. Then the homomorphism
bi : V ⊗U(g) →Y
corresponding to i : V ,→Y is surjective and factors through the
module V ⊗Uθ. Thus Y is a quotient of V ⊗Uθ. Thus we have
124

[PAGE 125]
Lemma 25.5. The abelian category HC1
θ has enough projectives.
We also note that this category has ﬁnite-dimensional Hom spaces.
Indeed, If Y1, Y2 ∈HC1
θ then Y1 is a quotient of V ⊗Uθ for some V ,
so Hom(Y1, Y2) ⊂Hom(V ⊗Uθ, Y2) = Homgad(V, Y2), which is ﬁnite-
dimensional. Finally, note that this category is Noetherian: any nested
sequence of subobjects of an object stabilizes.
It thus follows from the Krull-Schmidt theorem that in HC1
θ, every
object of HC1
θ is uniquely a ﬁnite direct sum of indecomposables, and
from Proposition 16.2 the indecomposable projectives and the simples
of HC1
θ labeled by the same index set.
It remains to describe this
labeling set.
Theorem 25.6. The simples (and indecomposable projectives) in HC1
θ
are labeled by the set Ξ, via ξ ∈Ξ 7→Lξ, Pξ. Namely, if ξ = (µ, λ) is a
proper representation then Pξ is the unique indecomposable projective
in HC1
θ such that Pξ ⊗U(g) Mλ−ρ = Pµ−ρ.
Proof. Every indecomposable projective is a direct summand of V ⊗Uθ.
But (V ⊗Uθ) ⊗U(g) Y = FV (θ)(Y ). Thus from the classiﬁcation of
projective functors (Theorem 23.6) it follows that the indecomposable
summands of V ⊗Uθ are Pξ such that Pξ⊗= Fξ(θ).
□
Corollary 25.7. Objects in HC1
θ, hence in HCθ and HC, have ﬁnite
length.
Proof. Recall that HC1
θ = ⊕χHC1
χ,θ, the decomposition according to
left generalized inﬁnitesimal characters. By Theorem 25.6, each sub-
category HC1
χ,θ has ﬁnitely many simple objects. Thus the statement
follows from Proposition 16.2.
□
25.3. Equivalence between category O and category of Harish-
Chandra bimodules. Let θ = χλ where λ is dominant. Let Oλ+P be
the full subcategory of O consisting of modules with weights in λ + P.
Deﬁne the functor
Tλ : HC1
θ →Oλ+P
given by Tλ(Y ) = Y ⊗U(g) Mλ−ρ. Also let O(λ) be the full subcategory
of Oλ+P of modules M which admit a presentation
Q1 →Q0 →M →0,
where Q0, Q1 are direct sums of Pµ−ρ with µ ∈λ + P and µ ⪯Wλµ.
Note that the functor Tλ is left adjoint to the functor Hλ deﬁned in
Subsection 19.3: Hλ(X) = Homﬁn(Mλ−ρ, X). Indeed,
Hom(Tλ(Y ), X) = Hom(Y ⊗U(g) Mλ−ρ, X) =
Hom(Y, Hom(Mλ−ρ, X)) = Hom(Y, Homﬁn(Mλ−ρ, X)) = Hom(Y, Hλ(X)).

(ii) In general, Tλ is fully faithful and deﬁnes an equivalence
HC1
θ ∼= O(λ),
with quasi-inverse Hλ.
Remark 25.9. Note that if λ is not regular then the subcategory
O(λ) ⊂O need not be closed under taking subquotients (even though
it is abelian by Theorem 25.8).
Also the functor Tλ (and thus the
inclusion O(λ) ,→O) need not be (left) exact. So if f : X →Y is a
morphism in O(λ) then its kernels in O(λ) and in O may diﬀer, and
in particular the latter may not belong to O(λ). See Example 26.2.
Proof. (i) is a special case of (ii), so let us prove (ii). To this end, we’ll
use the following general fact.
Proposition 25.10. Let A, B be abelian categories such that A has
enough projectives and T : A →B a right exact functor which maps
projectives to projectives. Suppose that T is fully faithful on projectives,
i.e., for any projectives P0, P1 ∈A, the natural map Hom(P1, P0) →
Hom(T(P1), T(P0)) is an isomorphism. Then T is fully faithful, and
deﬁnes an equivalence of A onto the subcategory of objects Y ∈B which
admit a presentation
T(P1) →T(P0) →Y →0
for some projectives P0, P1 ∈A.
Proof. We ﬁrst show that T is faithful. Let X, X′ ∈A and a : X →X′.
Pick presentations
P1 →P0 →X →0, P ′
1 →P ′
0 →X′ →0.
We have maps p0 : P0 →X, p′
0 : P ′
0 →X′, p1 : P1 →P0, p′
1 : P ′
1 →P ′
0.
There exist morphisms a0 : P0 →P ′
0, a1 : P1 →P ′
1 such that (a1, a0, a)
is a morphism of presentations.
Suppose T(a) = 0. Then T(p′
0)T(a0) = 0. Thus Y := ImT(a0) ⊂
KerT(p′
0) = ImT(p′
1).
Thus the map T(a0) : T(P0) →Y lifts to
b : T(P0) →T(P ′
1) such that T(a0) = T(p′
1)b. Since T is full on projec-
tives, we have b = T(c) for some c : P0 →P ′
1, so T(a0) = T(p′
1)T(c) =
T(p′
1c). Since T is faithful on projectives, this implies that a0 = p′
1c.
Thus Ima0 ⊂Imp′
1 = Kerp′
0. It follows that p′
0a0 = 0, hence ap0 = 0.
But p0 is an epimorphism, hence a = 0, as claimed.
126

[PAGE 127]
Now let us show that T is full. Let X, X′ ∈A and b : T(X) →T(X′).
The functor T maps the above presentations of X, X′ into presentations
of T(X), T(X′) (as it is right exact and maps projectives to projectives):
T(P1) →T(P0) →T(X) →0, T(P ′
1) →T(P ′
0) →T(X′) →0,
and we can ﬁnd b0 : T(P0) →T(P ′
0), b1 : T(P1) →T(P ′
1) such that
(b1, b0, b) is a morphism of presentations. Since T is fully faithful on
projectives, there exist a0, a1 such that T(a0) = b0, T(a1) = b1 and
a0p1 = p′
1a0. Thus a0 maps Imp1 = Kerp0 into Imp′
1 = Kerp′
0. This
implies that a0 descends to a : X →X′, and T(a)T(p0) = T(p′
0)b0.
Hence (T(a) −b)T(p0) = 0, so since T(p0) is an epimorphism we get
T(a) = b, as claimed.
If Y ∈Im(T) then Y = T(X) where X has presentation
P1 →P0 →X →0.
Thus Y has presentation
T(P1) →T(P0) →Y →0.
Conversely, if Y has such a presentation as a cokernel of a morphism
f : T(P1) →T(P0) then f = T(g) where g : P1 →P0, and Y =
T(Coker(g)), which proves the last claim of the proposition.
□
Now we are ready to prove Theorem 25.8. By Lemma 25.5, HC1
θ has
enough projectives. Also the functor Tλ is right exact, as it is given
by tensor product. Further, if P is projective then Hom(Tλ(P), Y ) =
Hom(P, Hλ(Y )) is exact in Y since Hλ is exact by Proposition 19.7
and P is projective. Thus Tλ(P) is projective. Finally, the fact that
Tλ is fully faithful on projectives was one of the main results about
projective functors (Theorem 22.4). So Proposition 25.10 applies to
A = HC1
θ, B = Oλ+P, T = Tλ. Moreover, the image of Tλ is precisely
the category O(λ) by the classiﬁcation of projective functors (Theorem
23.6).
For an equivalence of categories, a right adjoint is a quasi-inverse.
Thus Hλ is quasi-inverse of Tλ, as claimed. The theorem is proved.
□
Corollary 25.11. Every Harish-Chandra bimodule M with right in-
ﬁnitesimal character θ is realizable as Vﬁn where V is a (not necessar-
ily unitary) admissible representation of the complex simply connected
group G corresponding to g on a Hilbert space.
Proof. Let us prove the statement if θ = χλ where λ is a regular dom-
inant weight (the general proof is similar).
We have seen in Subsection 19.3 that Hλ(M ∨
µ−ρ) is the principal se-
ries module M(λ, µ) = Homﬁn(Mλ−ρ, M ∨
µ−ρ). Thus by Theorem 25.8
127

[PAGE 128]
M(λ, µ) is injective in HC1
θ if µ is dominant (since Mµ−ρ is projective,
hence M ∨
µ−ρ is injective). Moreover, since every indecomposable pro-
jective in Oλ+P is a direct summand of V ⊗Mµ−ρ for some dominant
µ and ﬁnite-dimensional g-module V , it follows that every indecom-
posable injective is a direct summand in V ⊗M ∨
µ−ρ for some V and
dominant µ. Hence by Theorem 25.8, every indecomposable injective
in HC1
θ is a direct summand in V ⊗M(λ, µ) for some V and domi-
nant µ. Thus any Y ∈HC1
θ is contained in a direct sum of objects
V ⊗M(λ, µ) for ﬁnite-dimensional V and dominant µ. Since principal
series modules M(λ, µ) are realizable in a Hilbert space by Proposition
19.5, we are done by Corollary 6.13.
□
Exercise 25.12. (i) Generalize the proof of Corollary 25.11 to non-
regular dominant weights λ.
(ii) Generalize Corollary 25.11 to any Harish-Chandra bimodule with
generalized inﬁnitesimal character θ, and then to any Harish-Chandra
bimodule.
Hint. Recall that C∞
λ,µ(G/B) is the space of smooth functions F on
G which satisfy the diﬀerential equations
(Rb −λ(b))F = (Rb −µ(b))F = 0
for b ∈b and b ∈b (here Rb is the vector ﬁeld corresponding to the
right translation by b). Now for N ≥1 consider the space C∞
λ,µ,N(G/B)
of smooth functions F on G satisfying the diﬀerential equations
(Rb −λ(b))NF = (Rb −µ(b))NF = 0.
(Note that C∞
λ,µ,1(G/B) = C∞
λ,µ(G/B).) Show that C∞
λ,µ,N(G/B) are
admissible representations of G on Fr´echet spaces. Then mimic the
proof of Corollary 25.11 using these instead of C∞
λ,µ(G/B).

26. Representations of SL2(C)
26.1. Harish-Chandra bimodules for sl2(C). Let us now work out
the simplest example, g = sl2(C). In this case h∗= C, P = Z, χλ =
λ2. So by Theorem 25.6, irreducible Harish-Chandra bimodules Lξ are
parametrized by pairs ξ = (µ, λ) of complex numbers such that λ −µ
is an integer, modulo the map (µ, λ) 7→(−µ, −λ), and we may (and
will) assume that (µ, λ) is a proper representation of ξ, i.e., λ /∈Z<0
and if λ = 0 then µ ∈Z≤0. Let us describe these bimodules in terms
of the principal series bimodules M(λ, µ).
Proposition 26.1. (i) The principal series bimodule M(λ, µ) is ir-
reducible and isomorphic to M(−λ, −µ) unless λ, µ are nonzero inte-
gers of the same sign.
Otherwise such bimodules are pairwise non-
isomorphic.
(ii) If λ, µ are both nonzero integers of the same sign then M(λ, µ) is
indecomposable and has a ﬁnite-dimensional constituent L∗
|λ|−1⊗L|µ|−1,
which is a submodule if λ > 0 and quotient if λ < 0.
The other
composition factor is M(λ, −µ) ∼= M(−λ, µ), which is irreducible.
(iii) If ξ = (µ, λ) is a proper representation with λ /∈Z≥1 then
Lξ = M(λ, µ). If ξ = (µ, λ) where λ ∈Z≥1 then Lξ = L∗
λ−1 ⊗Lµ−1 if
µ ≥1 and Lξ = M(λ, µ) if µ ≤0.
Proof. (i),(ii) Consider ﬁrst the case when λ and µ are both non-
integers. Then the weights ±λ are dominant and M ∨
±µ−1 are simple, so
by Theorem 25.8 M(λ, µ) is also simple and isomorphic to M(−λ, −µ).
Now suppose λ, µ are integers. Recall that M(λ, µ) decomposes over
the diagonal copy of g as
(18)
M(λ, µ) = ⊕j≥0L|λ−µ|+2j.
If λ = 0 and µ ≥0, then the equivalence Tλ = T0 maps M(0, ±µ)
to M ∨
±µ−1. So if µ = 0, we have a simple bimodule M(0, 0). On the
other hand, if µ > 0, we have two bimodules M(0, −µ), M(0, µ) and a
natural map
a : M(0, µ) = Homﬁn(M−1, M ∨
µ−1) →M(0, −µ) = Homﬁn(M−1, M ∨
−µ−1)
induced by the surjection M ∨
µ−1 →M ∨
−µ−1. The kernel of this map is
Kera = Homﬁn(M−1, Lµ−1) = 0, which implies that a is an isomorphism
(as the K-type of the bimodules M(0, µ), M(0, −µ) is the same by
(18)). So we have the simple bimodule M(µ, 0) = M(−µ, 0). If µ =
0, λ ̸= 0, the situation is similar, as λ and µ play a symmetric role.
It remains to consider the situation when λ, µ ∈Z\0. So let n, m be
positive integers. By Theorem 25.8, the bimodule M(n, −m) is simple,
129

[PAGE 130]
as it corresponds to the simple module M ∨
−m−1. Similarly, M(−n, m)
is simple. Now, we have homomorphisms
a : M(n, m) →M(n, −m), b : M(n, −m) →M(−n, −m).
Since M(n, −m) is simple and a ̸= 0, it is surjective, so in view of (18)
we have a short exact sequence
0 →L∗
n−1 ⊗Lm−1 →M(n, m) →M(n, −m) →0.
Similarly, since b ̸= 0, it is injective, so in view of (18) we have a short
exact sequence
0 →M(n, −m) →M(−m, −n) →L∗
n−1 ⊗Lm−1 →0.
Moreover, these sequences are not split by Theorem 25.8. This proves
(i),(ii).
(iii) follows immediately from (i),(ii). The proposition is proved.
□
Example 26.2. One may also describe explicitly the projectives Pξ.
As an example let us do so for ξ = (−1, 0). Consider the tensor product
L1 ⊗U0, which is a projective object. We have (L1 ⊗U0) ⊗U0 M−1 =
L1 ⊗M−1 = P−2, the big projective object with composition series
[M−2, C, M−2]. Thus L1 ⊗U0 = Pξ. Over the diagonal copy of g we
have
Pξ = L1 ⊗U0 = L1 ⊗(L0 ⊕L2 ⊕...) = 2L1 ⊕2L3 ⊕...
Thus we have a short exact sequence
(19)
0 →Lξ →Pξ →Lξ →0,
where Lξ = M(0, −1) = M(0, 1), which is not split.
This shows that the functor Tλ = T0 is not exact in this case. Indeed,
T0(Lξ) = M ∨
0 (M ∨
0 ∈O(0) with presentation P−2 →P−2 →M ∨
0 →0
and H0(M ∨
0 ) = M(0, 1)), so the image of (19) under T0 is the sequence
0 →M ∨
0 →P−2 →M ∨
0 →0,
which is not exact in the leftmost nontrivial term (the cohomology is
C). This sequence is, however, exact in the category O(0), which has
just two indecomposable objects M ∨
0 and P−2 (so O(0) is not closed
under taking subquotients and the inclusion O(0) ,→O is not exact).
26.2. Representations of SL2(C). Let us now consider represen-
tations of G = SL2(C).
We have g = sl2(C), K = SU(2).
We
have already classiﬁed the irreducible Harish-Chandra (bi)modules and
shown that the only ones are ﬁnite-dimensional modules and princi-
pal series modules. Moreover, we realized the principal series module
130

[PAGE 131]
M(λ, µ) as the space of K-ﬁnite vectors in the space of smooth func-
tions F : G →C such that
F(gb) = F(g)t(b)λ−µ|t(b)|2µ−2, b ∈B,
where B ⊂G is the subgroup of upper triangular matrices.
Thus,
similarly to the real case, setting µ −λ = m ∈Z, we may represent
M(λ, µ) as the space of polynomial tensor ﬁelds on CP1 = S2 of the
form
ω = φ(u)(du)
m
2 |du|1−µ,
and we have an admissible realization of M(λ, µ) by the vector space
C∞
λ−1,µ−1(G/B) of smooth tensor ﬁelds of the same form. The (right)
action of the group G on this space is given by

φ ◦

a
b
c
d

(u) = φ
au + b
cu + d

(cu + d)−m|cu + d|2µ−2.
We may also upgrade this realization to a Hilbert space realization by
completing it with respect to the inner product
∥ω∥2 =
Z
S2 |φ(u)|2dA,
where dA is the rotation-invariant probability measure on S2. However,
this inner product is not G-invariant, in general; it is only G-invariant if
Reµ = m
2 , i.e., µ = m
2 + s, s ∈iR. This shows that the (g, K)-modules
M(−m
2 + s, m
2 + s) are unitary and irreducible for any imaginary s,
with the Hilbert space completion being L2
−m
2 +s−1, m
2 +s−1(G/B) – the
unitary principal series.
Also the trivial representation is obviously unitary. Are there any
other unitary irreducible representations?
Clearly, they cannot be
ﬁnite-dimensional.
However, the answer is yes.
To ﬁnd them, let
us ﬁrst determine which M(λ, µ) are Hermitian. It is easy to show
that this happens whenever λ2 = µ2, i.e., λ = ±µ. If λ = −µ, we get
2Reµ = m, so µ = m
2 +s, λ = −m
2 +s, s ∈iR, exactly as above. On the
other hand, if λ = µ then we get µ−µ = m, which implies that m = 0,
i.e., λ = µ ∈R. In this case by Theorem 25.6 the module M(µ, µ) is
irreducible if and only if µ /∈Z. Thus we see that for 0 < |µ| < 1, this
module is unitary, as we have a continuous family of simple Hermitian
modules X(c) := M(√c, √c) for c ∈(−∞, 1), and these modules are in
the unitary principal series for c ≤0. This family of unitary modules
for c > 0 (0 < |µ| < 1) is called the complementary series; it is
analogous to the complementary series in the real case.
It remains to consider the intervals m < |µ| < m + 1 for m ∈Z≥0.
If M(µ, µ) is unitary for at least one point in such interval, then it is
131

[PAGE 132]
so for the whole interval, and taking the limit µ →m + 1, we see that
L∗
m+1 ⊗Lm+1, which is a composition factor of M(m+1, m+1), would
have to be unitary, which it is not. This shows that we have no unitary
modules in these intervals. Thus we obtain the following result.
Theorem 26.3. (Gelfand-Naimark) The irreducible unitary represen-
tations of SL2(C) are Hilbert space completions of the following unitary
Harish-Chandra modules:
• Unitary principal series M(−m
2 + s, m
2 + s), m ∈Z, s ∈iR;
• Complementary series M(s, s), −1 < s < 1;
• The trivial representation C.
Here M(−m
2 +s, m
2 +s) ∼= M(m
2 −s, −m
2 −s), M(s, s) = M(−s, −s)
and there are no other isomorphisms.
Exercise 26.4. Compute the map M 7→M ∨from Exercise 5.17 on
the set of irreducible Harish-Chandra modules for SL2(R) and SL2(C).
Exercise 26.5. The following exercise is the complex analog of Exer-
cise 9.6.
(i) Show that for −1 < s < 0 the formula
(f, g)s :=
Z
C2 f(y)g(z)|y −z|−2s−2dydydzdz
deﬁnes a positive deﬁnite inner product on the space C0(C) of continu-
ous functions f : C →C with compact support (Hint: pass to Fourier
transforms).
(ii) Deduce that if f is a measurable function on C then
0 ≤(f, f)s ≤∞,
so measurable functions f with (f, f)s < ∞modulo those for which
(f, f)s = 0 form a Hilbert space Hs with inner product (, )s, which is
the completion of C0(C) under (, )s.
(iii) Let us view Hs as the space of tensor ﬁelds f(y)|dy|1−s, where f
is as in (ii). Show that the complementary series unitary representation
c
M(s, s) of SL2(C) may be realized in Hs with G acting naturally on
such tensor ﬁelds.

27. Geometry of complex semisimple Lie groups
27.1. The Borel-Weil theorem. Let G be a simply connected semisim-
ple complex Lie group with Lie algebra g and a Borel subgroup B
generated by a maximal torus T ⊂G and the 1-parameter subgroups
exp(tei), i ∈Π. Given an integral weight λ ∈P, we can deﬁne the cor-
responding algebraic (in particular, holomorphic) line bundle Lλ on the
ﬂag variety G/B. Namely, the total space T(Lλ) of Lλ is (G × C)/B,
where B acts by
(g, z)b = (gb, λ(b)−1z),
and the line bundle Lλ is deﬁned by the projection π : T(Lλ) →G/B
to the ﬁrst component. So this bundle is G-equivariant, i.e., G acts on
T(Lλ) by left multiplication preserving the projection map π. We also
see that smooth sections of Lλ are smooth functions F : G →C such
that
(g, F(g))b = (gb, F(gb)), b ∈B,
which yields
F(gb) = λ(b)−1F(g), b ∈B.
It follows that the space of smooth sections ΓC∞(G/B, Lλ) coincides
with the admissible G-module C∞
−λ,0(G/B), realizing the principal se-
ries module M(−λ + 1, 1) = Homﬁn(M−λ, M ∨
0 ).
Remark 27.1. Recall that H2(G/B, Z) = P. It is easy to check that
the ﬁrst Chern class c1(Lλ) equals λ. This motivates the minus sign in
the deﬁnition of Lλ.
Example 27.2. Let G = SL2(C), so that B is the subgroup of upper
triangular matrices with determinant 1 and G/B = CP1. Then sections
of Lm are functions F : G →C such that F(gb) = t(b)−mF(g), where
t(b) = b11. Thus Lm ∼= O(−m).
Let us now consider holomorphic sections of Lλ. The space Vλ of
such sections is a proper subrepresentation of C∞
−λ,0(G/B), namely the
subspace where the left copy of g (acting by antiholomorphic vector
ﬁelds) acts trivially. Thus V ﬁn
λ
= Homﬁn(M−λ, C) ⊂Homﬁn(M−λ, M ∨
0 ),
and Vλ = V ﬁn
λ
since V ﬁn
λ
is ﬁnite-dimensional. It follows that V ﬁn
λ
= 0
unless λ ∈−P+, and in the latter case Vλ = L∗
−λ = L−
λ = Lw0λ, the
ﬁnite-dimensional representation of G with lowest weight λ. Thus we
obtain
Theorem 27.3. (Borel-Weil) Let λ ∈P. If λ ∈P+ then we have an
isomorphism of G-modules
Γ(G/B, L−λ) ∼= L∗
λ.
133

[PAGE 134]
If λ /∈P+ then Γ(G/B, L−λ) = 0.
Example 27.4. Let G = SL2(C). Then Theorem 27.3 says that
Γ(CP1, O(m)) ∼= Lm = Cm+1
as representations of G.
More generally, suppose λ ∈P and (λ, α∨
i ) = 0, i ∈S for a subset
S ⊂Π of the set of simple roots. Then we have a parabolic subgroup
PS ⊂G generated by B and also exp(tfi) for i ∈S, and λ extends to a
1-dimensional representation of PS. Thus we can deﬁne the line bundle
Lλ,S on the partial ﬂag variety G/PS in the same way as Lλ, and we
have Lλ = p∗
SLλ,S, where pS : G/B →G/PS is the natural projection.
Note that any holomorphic section of Lλ is just a function when
restricted to a ﬁber F ∼= PS/B of the ﬁbration pS (a compact complex
manifold), so by the maximum principle it must be constant. It follows
that Γ(G/B, Lλ) = Γ(G/PS, Lλ,S). Thus we get
Corollary 27.5. Let λ ∈P with (λ, α∨
i ) = 0, i ∈S. Then
Γ(G/PS, L−λ,S) ∼= L∗
λ.
if λ ∈P+, otherwise Γ(G/PS, L−λ,S) = 0.
Example 27.6. Let G = SLn(C) = SL(V ), V = Cn, and PS ⊂
G be the subgroup of matrices b such that br1 = 0 for r > 1 (this
corresponds to S = {2, ..., n −1}). Then G/PS = CPn−1 = PV . The
condition (λ, α∨
i ) = 0, i ∈S means that λ = mω1, and in this case
Lm,S = O(−m). So Corollary 27.5 says that
Γ(PV, O(m)) = Lmωn−1 = SmV ∗
for m ≥0, and zero for m < 0. This is also clear from elementary con-
siderations, as by deﬁnition Γ(PV, O(m)) is the space of homogeneous
polynomials on V of degree m.
In fact, for λ ∈P+ we can construct an isomorphism L∗
λ ∼= Γ(G/B, L−λ)
explicitly as follows. Let vλ be a highest weight vector of Lλ, ℓ∈L∗
λ,
and Fℓ(g) := (ℓ, gvλ). Then
Fℓ(gb) = λ(b)Fℓ(g), b ∈B.
Thus the assignment ℓ→Fℓdeﬁnes a linear map L∗
λ →Γ(G/B, L−λ)
which is easily seen to be an isomorphism.
This shows that the bundle L−λ is globally generated, i.e., for
every x ∈G/B there exists s ∈Γ(G/B, L−λ) such that s(x) ̸= 0. In
other words, we have a regular map iλ : G/B →PLλ deﬁned as follows.
134

[PAGE 135]
For x ∈G/B, choose a basis vector u of the ﬁber of L−λ at x and deﬁne
iλ(x) ∈Lλ by the equality
s(x) = iλ(x)(s)u
for s ∈Γ(G/B, L−λ) ∼= L∗
λ. Then iλ(x) is well deﬁned (does not depend
on the choice of u) up to scaling and is nonzero, so gives rise to a well
deﬁned element of the projective space PLλ. Another deﬁnition of this
map is
iλ(x) = x(Cvλ).
This shows that iλ is an embedding when λ is regular, i.e., in this
case the line bundle Lλ is very ample. On the other hand, if λ is
not necessarily regular and S is the set of j such that (λ, α∨
j ) = 0 then
iλ : G/PS →PLλ is an embedding, so the bundle L−λ,S over the partial
ﬂag variety G/PS is very ample.
Example 27.7. Let G = SLn(C) and λ = ωk. Then S = [1, n−1]\k, so
PS ⊂G is the subgroup of matrices with gij = 0, i > k, j ≤k and G/PS
is the Grassmannian Gr(k, n) of k-dimensional subspaces in Cn. In this
case Lλ = ∧kCn, so iλ is the Pl¨ucker embedding Gr(k, n) ,→P(∧kCn).
27.2. The Springer resolution. Recall that a resolution of singu-
larities of an irreducible algebraic variety X is a morphism p : Y →X
from a smooth variety Y that is proper (for example, projective20) and
birational. Hironaka proved in 1960s that any variety over a ﬁeld of
characteristic zero has a resolution of singularities. However, it is not
unique and this theorem does not provide a nice explicit construction
of a resolution.
A basic example of a singular variety arising in Lie theory is the
nilpotent cone N of a semisimple Lie algebra g. This variety turns
out to admit a very explicit equivariant resolution called the Springer
resolution, which plays an important role in representation theory.
To deﬁne the Springer resolution, consider the cotangent bundle T ∗F
of the ﬂag variety F of G. Recall that F is the variety of Borel subal-
gebras b ⊂g. For b ∈F, we have an isomorphism g/b ∼= TbF deﬁned
by the action of G. Thus T ∗F can be viewed as the set of pairs (b, x),
where x ∈(g/b)∗. Note that (g/b)∗∼= b⊥under the Killing form, and
b⊥= [b, b] is the maximal nilpotent subalgebra of b. Thus T ∗F is the
variety of pairs (b, x) where b ∈F is a Borel subalgebra of g and x ∈b
is a nilpotent element.
20Recall that a morphism f : X →Y is said to be projective if f = π ◦ef
where ef : X →Z × Y is a closed embedding for some projective variety Z and
π : Z × Y →Y is the projection to the second component.
135

[PAGE 136]
Now we can deﬁne the Springer map p : T ∗F →N given by
p(b, x) = x. Note that this map is G-equivariant, so its ﬁbers over
conjugate elements of N are isomorphic.
Theorem 27.8. The Springer map p is birational and projective, so it
is a resolution of singularities.
Proof. To show that p is birational, it suﬃces to prove that if e ∈N
is regular, the Borel subalgebra b containing e is unique. To this end,
note that dim T ∗F = 2 dim F = dim N and the map p is surjective (as
any nilpotent element is contained in a Borel subalgebra). Thus p is
generically ﬁnite, i.e., p−1(e) is a ﬁnite set, and our job is to show that
it consists of one element.
We may ﬁx a decomposition g = n+ ⊕h ⊕n−and assume that
e = Pr
i=1 ei. Then we have [ρ∨, e] = e, so the group {tρ∨, t ̸= 0} ∼= C×
acts on p−1(e) (as any Borel subalgebra containing e also contains te).
Since p−1(e) is ﬁnite, this action must be trivial. Thus ρ∨normalizes
every b ∈p−1(e), hence is contained in every such b. But ρ∨is regular,
so is contained in a unique Cartan subalgebra, namely h. Since every
semisimple element in a Borel subalgebra b ⊂g is contained in a Cartan
subalgebra sitting inside b, it follows that h ⊂b for all b ∈p−1(e).
Thus [ω∨
i , e] = ei ∈b for all i. It follows that b = b+ := h ⊕n+, i.e.,
|p−1(e)| = 1, as claimed.
Now let us show that p is projective. Let ep : T ∗F →F × N be the
map deﬁned by ep(b, x) = (b, x). This is clearly a closed embedding
(the image is deﬁned by the equation x ∈b). But p = π ◦ep where
π : F × N →N is the projection to the second component. Thus p is
projective, as claimed.
□
Remark 27.9. The preimage p−1(e) for e ∈N is called the Springer
ﬁber. If e is not regular, p−1(e) has positive dimension. It is a projec-
tive variety, which is in general singular, reducible and has complicated
structure, but it plays an important role in representation theory.
Example 27.10. Let g = sl2. Then N is the usual quadratic cone
yz + x2 = 0 in C3, and T ∗F = T ∗CP 1 is the blow-up of the vertex in
this cone.
27.3. The symplectic structure on coadjoint orbits. Recall that
a smooth real manifold, complex manifold or algebraic variety X is
symplectic if it is equipped with a nondegenerate closed 2-form ω. It
is clear that in this case X has even dimension.
Theorem 27.11. (Kirillov-Kostant) Let G be a connected real or com-
plex Lie group or complex algebraic group. Then every G-orbit in g∗
has a natural symplectic structure.
136

[PAGE 137]
Proof. Let O be a G-orbit in g∗and f ∈O. Then TfO = g/gf where gf
is the set of x ∈g such that f([x, y]) = 0 for all y ∈g. Deﬁne a skew-
symmetric bilinear form ωf : g × g →C given by ωf(y, z) = f([y, z]).
It is clear that Kerωf = gf, so ωf deﬁnes a nondegenerate form on
g/gf = TfO.
This deﬁnes a nondegenerate G-invariant diﬀerential
2-form ω on O.
It remains to show that ω is closed. Let Lx be the vector ﬁeld on
O deﬁned by the action of x ∈g; thus L[x,y] = [Lx, Ly]. It suﬃces to
show that for any x, y, z ∈g we have dω(Lx, Ly, Lz) = 0. By Cartan’s
diﬀerentiation formula we have
dω(Lx, Ly, Lz) = Alt(Lxω(Ly, Lz) −ω([Lx, Ly], Lz)),
where Alt denotes the sum over cyclic permutations of x, y, z. Since ω
is G-invariant, this yields
dω(Lx, Ly, Lz)(f) = Alt(ω(Ly, L[x,z]))(f) = f(Alt([y, [x, z]])),
which vanishes by the Jacobi identity.
□
Corollary 27.12. The singular locus of the nilpotent cone N has codi-
mension ≥2.
Proof. This follows since N has ﬁnitely many orbits (Exercise 17.8)
and by Theorem 27.11 they all have even dimension.
□
Corollary 27.13. N is normal (i.e., the algebra O(N) is integrally
closed in its quotient ﬁeld).
Proof. This follows from Corollary 27.12 since N is a complete inter-
section and any complete intersection whose singular locus has codi-
mension ≥2 is necessarily normal ([H], Chapter II, Prop. 8.23).
□
27.4. The algebra of functions on T ∗F. We will ﬁrst recall some
facts about normal algebraic varieties.
Proposition 27.14. Let Y be an irreducible normal algebraic variety.
Then
(i) ([Eis], Proposition 11.5) The singular locus of Y has codimension
≥2.
(ii) ([Eis], Proposition 11.4) If U ⊂Y is an open subset and Y \U has
codimension ≥2 then any regular function f on U extends to a regular
function on Y . In particular, any regular function on the smooth locus
of Y extends to a regular function on Y .
(iii) Zariski main theorem ([H], Corollary III.11.4). If X is irre-
ducible and p : X →Y is a proper birational morphism then ﬁbers of
p are connected.
137

[PAGE 138]
Proposition 27.15. Let Y be an irreducible normal aﬃne algebraic
variety and p : X →Y be a resolution of singularities.
Then the
homomorphism p∗: O(Y ) →O(X) is an isomorphism.
Proof. It is clear that p∗is injective, so we only need to show it is
surjective. Let f ∈O(X). Since every ﬁber of p is proper, and also
connected due to normality of Y by Proposition 27.14(iii), f is constant
along this ﬁber. So f = h ◦p for h : Y →C a rational function. It
remains to show that h is regular. We know that h is regular on the
smooth locus of Y (as it is deﬁned at all points of Y ). Thus the result
follows from the normality of Y and Proposition 27.14(i),(ii).
□
Theorem 27.16. Let p : T ∗F →N be the Springer resolution. Then
the map p∗: O(N) →O(T ∗F) is an isomorphism of graded algebras.
Proof. This follows from Proposition 27.15 and the normality of N
(Corollary 27.13).

28. D-modules - I
We would now like to formulate the Beilinson-Bernstein localization
theorems. We ﬁrst review generalities about diﬀerential operators and
D-modules.
28.1. Diﬀerential operators. Let k be an algebraically closed ﬁeld
of characteristic zero. Let X be a smooth aﬃne algebraic variety over
k.
Let O(X) be the algebra of regular functions on X.
Following
Grothendieck, we deﬁne inductively the notion of a diﬀerential operator
of order (at most) N on X. Namely, a diﬀerential operator of order
−1 is zero, and a k-linear operator L : O(X) →O(X) is a diﬀerential
operator of order N ≥0 if for all f ∈O(X), the operator [L, f] is a
diﬀerential operator of order N −1.
Let DN(X) denote the space of diﬀerential operators of order N. We
have
0 = D−1(X) ⊂O(X) = D0(X) ⊂D1(X) ⊂... ⊂DN(X) ⊂...
and Di(X)Dj(X) ⊂Di+j(X), which implies that the nested union
D(X) := ∪i≥0Di(X) is a ﬁltered algebra.
Deﬁnition 28.1. D(X) is called the algebra of diﬀerential oper-
ators on X.
Exercise 28.2. Prove the following statements.
1. [Di(X), Dj(X)] ⊂Di+j−1(X) for i, j ≥0. In particular, [, ] makes
D1(X) a Lie algebra naturally isomorphic to Vect(X) ⋉O(X), where
Vect(X) is the Lie algebra of vector ﬁelds on X.
2. Suppose x1, ..., xn ∈O(X) are regular functions such that dx1, ..., dxn
form a basis in each cotangent space to X. Let ∂1, ..., ∂n be the corre-
sponding vector ﬁelds. For m = (m1, ..., mn) ∈Zn
≥0, let |m| := Pn
i=1 mi
and ∂m := ∂m1
1 ...∂mn
n . Then DN(X) is a free ﬁnite rank O(X)-module
(under left multiplication) with basis {∂m} with |m| ≤N, and D(X)
is a free O(X)-module with basis {∂m} for all m.
3. One has gr D(X) = ⊕i≥0Γ(X, SiTX) = O(T ∗X). In particular,
D(X) is left and right Noetherian.
4. D(X) is generated by O(X) and elements Lv, v ∈Vect(X) (de-
pending linearly on v), with deﬁning relations
(20)
[f, g] = 0, [Lv, f] = v(f), Lfv = fLv, [Lv, Lw] = L[v,w],
where f, g ∈O(X), v, w ∈Vect(X).
5.
If U ⊂X is an aﬃne open set then the multiplication map
O(U) ⊗O(X) D(X) →D(U) is a ﬁltered isomorphism.
139

[PAGE 140]
28.2. D-modules.
Deﬁnition 28.3. A left (respectively, right) D-module on X is a
left (respectively, right) D(X)-module.
Example 28.4. 1. O(X) is an obvious example of a left D-module on
X. Also, Ω(X) (the space of top diﬀerential forms on X) is naturally a
right D-module on X, via ρ(L) = L∗(the adjoint diﬀerential operator
to L with respect to the “integration pairing” between functions and
top forms). More precisely, f ∗= f for f ∈O(X), and L∗
v is the action
of the vector ﬁeld −v on top forms (by Lie derivative). Finally, D(X)
is both a left and a right D-module on X.
2. Suppose k = C, and f is a holomorphic function deﬁned on some
open set in X (in the usual topology). Then M(f) := D(X)f is a
left D-module. We have a natural surjection D(X) →M(f) whose
kernel is the left ideal generated by the linear diﬀerential equations
satisﬁed by f. E.g. M(1) = O(X) = D(X)/D(X)Vect(X), M(xs) =
D(C)/D(C)(x∂−s) if s /∈Z≥0, M(ex) = D(C)/D(C)(∂−1). Similarly,
if ξ is a distribution (e.g., a measure) then ξ·D(X) is a right D-module.
For instance, δ · D(C) = D(C)/xD(C), where δ is the delta-measure
on the line.
Exercise 28.5. Show that O(X) is a simple D(X)-module. Deduce
that for any nonzero regular function f on X, M(f) = O(X).
28.3. D-modules on non-aﬃne varieties. Now assume that X is a
smooth variety which is not necessarily aﬃne. Recall that a quasico-
herent sheaf on X is a sheaf M of OX-modules (in Zariski topology)
such that for any aﬃne open sets U ⊂V ⊂X the restriction map
induces an isomorphism of O(U)-modules O(U) ⊗O(V ) M(V ) ∼= M(U).
Exercise 28.2(5) implies that there exists a canonical quasicoherent
sheaf of algebras DX on X such that Γ(U, DX) = D(U) for any aﬃne
open set U ⊂X. This sheaf is called the sheaf of diﬀerential oper-
ators on X.
Deﬁnition 28.6. A left (respectively, right) D-module on X is a
quasicoherent sheaf of left (respectively, right) DX-modules. The cat-
egories of left (respectively, right) D-modules on X (with obviously
deﬁned morphisms) are denoted by Ml(X) and Mr(X).
It is clear that these are abelian categories. We will mostly use the
category Ml(X) and denote it shortly by M(X).
Note that if X is aﬃne, this deﬁnition is equivalent to the previous
one (by taking global sections).
As before, the basic examples are OX (a left D-module), ΩX (a right
D-module), DX (both a left and a right D-module).
140

[PAGE 141]
We see that the notion of a D-module on X is local. For this reason,
many questions about D-modules are local and reduce to the case of
aﬃne varieties.
28.4. Connections. The deﬁnition of a DX-module can be reformu-
lated in terms of connections on an OX-module. Namely, in diﬀerential
geometry we have a theory of connections on vector bundles. An al-
gebraic vector bundle on X is the same thing as a coherent, locally
free OX-module. It turns out that the usual deﬁnition of a connec-
tion, when written algebraically, makes sense for any OX-module (i.e.,
quasicoherent sheaf), not necessarily coherent or locally free.
Namely, let X be a smooth variety and Ωi
X be the OX-module of
diﬀerential i-forms on X.
Deﬁnition 28.7. A connection on an OX-module M is a k-linear
morphism of sheaves ∇: M →M ⊗OX Ω1
X such that
∇(fm) = f∇(m) + m ⊗df
for local sections f of OX and m of M.
Thus for each v ∈Vect(X) we have the operator of covariant deriv-
ative ∇v : M →M given on local sections by ∇v(m) := ∇(m)(v).
Exercise 28.8. Let X be an aﬃne variety. Show that the operator
m 7→([∇v, ∇w] −∇[v,w])m is O(X)-linear in v, w, m.
Given a connection ∇on M, deﬁne the OX-linear map
∇2 : M →M ⊗OX Ω2
X
given on local sections by
∇2(m)(v, w) := ([∇v, ∇w] −∇[v,w])m.
This map is called the curvature of ∇. We say that ∇is ﬂat if its
curvature vanishes: ∇2 = 0.
Proposition 28.9. A left DX-module is the same thing as an OX-
module with a ﬂat connection.
Proof. Given an OX-module M with a ﬂat connection ∇, we extend
the OX-action to a DX-action by ρ(Lv) = ∇v. The ﬁrst three relations
of (20) then hold for any connection, while the last relation holds due
to ﬂatness of ∇. Conversely, the same formula can be used to deﬁne a
ﬂat connection ∇on any DX-module M.
□
Exercise 28.10. Show that if a left D-module M on X is O-coherent
(i.e.
a coherent sheaf on X) then it is locally free, i.e., is a vector
bundle with a ﬂat connection, and vice versa.
141

[PAGE 142]
28.5. Direct and inverse images. Let π : X →Y be a morphism of
smooth aﬃne varieties. This morphism gives rise to a homomorphism
π∗: O(Y ) →O(X), making O(X) an O(Y )-module, and a morphism
of vector bundles π∗: TX →π∗TY . This induces a map on global
sections π∗: Vect(X) →O(X) ⊗O(Y ) Vect(Y ).
Deﬁne
DX→Y = O(X) ⊗O(Y ) D(Y ).
This is clearly a right D(Y )-module. Let us show that it also has a
commuting left D(X)-action. The left action of O(X) is obvious, so it
remains to construct a ﬂat connection. Given a vector ﬁeld v on X, let
(21)
∇v(f ⊗L) = v(f) ⊗L + fπ∗(v)L, f ∈O(X), L ∈D(Y ),
where we view π∗(v) as an element of DX→Y . This is well deﬁned since
for a ∈O(Y ) one has [π∗(v), a] = v(a) ⊗1.
Exercise 28.11. Show that this deﬁnes a ﬂat connection on DX→Y .
Now we deﬁne the inverse image functor π∗: Ml(Y ) →Ml(X)
by
π!(N) = DX→Y ⊗D(Y ) N
and the direct image functor π∗: Mr(X) →Mr(Y ) by
π∗(M) = M ⊗D(X) DX→Y .
Note that at the level of quasicoherent sheaves, π∗is the usual inverse
image.
These functors are right exact are compatible with compositions.
Also by deﬁnition, DX→Y = π!(D(Y )).
Note that π!(N) = O(X)⊗O(Y )N as an O(X)-module (i.e., the usual
pullback of O-modules), with the connection deﬁned by the formula
similar to (21):
∇v(f ⊗m) = v(f) ⊗m + f∇π∗(v)(m), f ∈O(X), m ∈M.
This means that the deﬁnition of π! is local both on X and on Y . On
the contrary, the deﬁnition of π∗is local only on Y but not on X. For
example, if Y is a point and dim X = d then π∗ΩX = Hd(X, k), the
algebraic de Rham cohomology of X of degree d.
Thus we can use the same deﬁnition locally to deﬁne π! for any
morphism of smooth varieties, and π∗for an aﬃne morphism (i.e. such
that π−1(U) is aﬃne for any aﬃne open set U ⊂Y ), for example, a
closed embedding. On the other hand, due to the non-local nature of
direct image with respect to X the correct functor π∗for a non-aﬃne
morphism is not the derived functor of anything and can be deﬁned
only in the derived category.

29. The Beilinson-Bernstein Localization Theorem
29.1. The Beilinson-Bernstein localization theorem for the zero
inﬁnitesimal character. Let g be a complex semisimple Lie algebra
and U0 be the maximal quotient of U(g) corresponding to the inﬁni-
tesimal character χρ = χ−ρ of the trivial representation of g. Recall
that gr(U0) = O(N). Let G be the corresponding simply connected
complex group and F the ﬂag variety of G; thus F ∼= G/B for a Borel
subgroup B ⊂G. Let D(F) be the algebra of global diﬀerential opera-
tors on F; it is clear that grD(F) ⊂O(T ∗F). Also, we have a natural
ﬁltration-preserving action map a : U(g) →D(F), induced by the Lie
algebra homomorphism g →Vect(F).
Theorem 29.1. (Beilinson-Bernstein, [BB]) (i) The homomorphism
a : U(g) →D(F) factors through a homomorphism a0 : U0 →D(F).
(ii) One has gr(a0) = p∗where p is the Springer map T ∗F →N.
(iii) grD(F) = O(T ∗F) and a0 is an isomorphism.
Proof. (i) Let z ∈Z(g) be an element acting by zero in the trivial
representation of g. Our job is to show that for any rational function
f ∈C(F) we have a(z)f = 0. Writing F as G/B, we may view f as
a rational function on G such that f(gb) = f(g), b ∈B. The function
a(z)f on G is the result of action on f of the right-invariant diﬀerential
operator Lz corresponding to z: a(z)f = Lzf.
Since z is central,
this operator is also left-invariant: Lz = Rz.
Since z acts by zero
on the trivial representation, using the Harish-Chandra isomorphism,
we may write z as P
i cibi, where bi ∈b := Lie(B) and ci ∈U(g).
Thus Rz = P
i RciRbi. But Rbif = 0 since f is invariant under right
translations by B. Thus Rzf = 0 and we are done.
(ii) It suﬃces to check the statement in degrees 0 and 1, where it is
straightforward.
(iii) The statement follows from (i), (ii) and the fact that p∗is an
isomorphism (Theorem 27.16).
□
The isomorphism a0 gives rise to two functors: the functor of global
sections Γ : M(F) →D(F) −mod ∼= U0 −mod and the functor
of localization Loc : U0 −mod ∼= D(F) −mod →M(F) given by
Loc(M)(U) := D(U) ⊗D(F) M for an aﬃne open set U ⊂F. Note that
by deﬁnition the functor Loc is left adjoint to Γ.
The following theorem is a starting point for the geometric represen-
tation theory of semisimple Lie algebras (in particular, for the original
proof of the Kazhdan-Lusztig conjecture).
143

[PAGE 144]
Theorem 29.2. (Beilinson-Bernstein localization theorem, [BB]) The
functors Γ and Loc are mutually inverse equivalences. Thus the cate-
gory U0 −mod is canonically equivalent to the category of D-modules
on the ﬂag variety F.
We will not give a proof of this theorem here.
Theorem 29.2 motivates the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition
29.3. A smooth algebraic variety X is said to be
D-aﬃne if the global sections functor Γ : M(X) →D(X) −mod
is an equivalence (hence Loc is its inverse).
It is clear that any aﬃne variety is D-aﬃne. Also we have
Corollary 29.4. Partial ﬂag varieties of semisimple algebraic groups
are D-aﬃne.
29.2. Twisted diﬀerential operators and D-modules. We would
now like to generalize the localization theorem to nonzero inﬁnitesimal
characters. To do so, we have to replace usual diﬀerential operators
and D-modules by twisted ones.
Let T be an algebraic torus with character lattice P := Hom(T, C×)
and e
X be a principal T-bundle over a smooth algebraic variety X
(with T acting on the right). In this case, given λ ∈P, we can deﬁne
the line bundle Lλ on X whose total space is e
X ×T Cλ, where Cλ is
the 1-dimensional representation of T corresponding to λ, and we can
consider the sheaf Dλ,X of diﬀerential operators acting on local sections
of Lλ (rather than functions).
Moreover, unlike the bundle Lλ, the sheaf Dλ,X makes sense not just
for λ ∈P but more generally for λ ∈P ⊗ZC. Namely, assuming for now
that λ ∈P, we may think of rational sections of Lλ as rational functions
F on e
X such that F(yt) = λ(t)−1F(y) for y ∈e
X.
A diﬀerential
operator D on e
X may be applied to such a function, and if ξ ∈t :=
Lie(T) then the ﬁrst order diﬀerential operator Rξ −λ(ξ) acts by zero:
(Rξ −λ(ξ))F = 0. Thus given an aﬃne open set U ⊂X with preimage
eU ⊂e
X, the space
Dλ(U) := (D(eU)/D(eU)(Rξ −λ(ξ), ξ ∈t))T
is naturally an associative algebra which acts on rational sections of
Lλ (check it!). Moreover, it is easy to check that Dλ(U) = Dλ,X(U).
Now it remains to note that the deﬁnition of Dλ(U) does not use the
integrality of λ, thus makes sense for all λ ∈P ⊗Z C.
Thus for any λ ∈P ⊗Z C we obtain a quasicoherent sheaf of alge-
bras Dλ,X on X which is called the sheaf of λ-twisted diﬀerential
144

[PAGE 145]
operators. If λ = 0, this sheaf coincides with the sheaf DX of usual
diﬀerential operators, and in general it has very similar properties, for
example gr(Dλ,X(U)) = O(T ∗U) for any aﬃne open set U ⊂X. A
quasicoherent sheaf on X with the structure of a (left or right) Dλ,X-
module is called a (left or right) λ-twisted D-module on X. For
example, if λ ∈P then Lλ is a left Dλ,X-module. The category of such
modules is denoted by Mλ(X) (of course, it depends on the princi-
pal bundle e
X but we do not indicate it in the notation). Note that
for β ∈P we have an equivalence Mλ(X) ∼= Mλ+β(X) deﬁned by
tensoring with Lβ.
Example 29.5. Let L be a line bundle on X and c ∈k.
Let e
X
be the subset of nonzero vectors in the total space of L. We have a
natural action of T := k× on e
X by dilations, and c deﬁnes a character
of Lie(T). Thus we can deﬁne the sheaf Dc,L,X of twisted diﬀerential
operators on X, and if c ∈Z then Dc,L,X = DX(L⊗c) is the sheaf
of diﬀerential operators on L⊗c. For example, if ΩX is the canonical
bundle of X then D1,Ω,X = DX(Ω) is naturally isomorphic to the sheaf
of usual diﬀerential operators with opposite multiplication, Dop
X .
Thus tensoring with Ωdeﬁnes a canonical equivalence
Ml(X) ∼= Mr(X)
(i.e., the sheaf DX is Morita equivalent, although not in general iso-
morphic, to Dop
X ).
We may therefore not distinguish between these
categories any more, identifying them by this equivalence, and can use
left or right D-modules depending on what is more convenient.
29.3. The localization theorem for non-zero inﬁnitesimal char-
acters. We are now ready to generalize the localization theorem to
non-zero inﬁnitesimal characters. Let Uλ be the minimal quotient of
U(g) corresponding to the inﬁnitesimal character χλ−ρ. Recall that
gr(Uλ) = O(N).
Let eF := G/[B, B]. We have a right action of T := B/[B, B] on
this variety by y 7→yt, deﬁning the structure of a principal T-bundle
eF →F. Thus for every λ ∈P ⊗Z C = h∗we have a sheaf of λ-twisted
diﬀerential operators Dλ,F = Dλ on F. For example, if λ ∈P then Dλ
is the sheaf of diﬀerential operators acting on sections of the line bundle
Lλ appearing in the Borel-Weil theorem (Theorem 27.3). Let Dλ(F)
be the algebra of global λ-twisted diﬀerential operators on F; it is clear
that grDλ(F) ⊂O(T ∗F). Also, we have a natural ﬁltration-preserving
action map a : U(g) →Dλ(F).
145

[PAGE 146]
Theorem 29.6. (Beilinson-Bernstein) (i) The map
a : U(g) →Dλ(F)
factors through a map aλ : Uλ →Dλ(F).
(ii) One has gr(aλ) = p∗where p is the Springer map T ∗F →N.
(iii) grDλ(F) = O(T ∗F) and aλ is an isomorphism.
Proof. The proof is completely parallel to the proof of Theorem 29.1.
□
As in the untwisted case, the isomorphism aλ gives rise to two func-
tors: the functor of global sections
Γ : Mλ(F) →Dλ(F) −mod ∼= Uλ −mod
and the functor of localization
Loc : Uλ −mod ∼= Dλ(F) −mod →Mλ(F)
given by Loc(M)(U) := Dλ(U)⊗Dλ(F) M for an aﬃne open set U ⊂F.
Moreover, as before, Loc is left adjoint to Γ.
Let us say that λ ∈h∗is antidominant if −λ is dominant (cf.
Subsection 16.1).
Theorem 29.7. (Beilinson-Bernstein localization theorem) If λ is an-
tidominant then the functors Γ and Loc are mutually inverse equiva-
lences. Thus the category Uλ −mod is canonically equivalent to the
category of Dλ-modules on the ﬂag variety F.
Remark 29.8. 1. As explained above, for β ∈P we have an equiv-
alence Mλ(F) ∼= Mλ+β(F) deﬁned by tensoring with Lβ.
On the
other side of the Beilinson-Bernstein equivalence this corresponds to
translation functors deﬁned in Subsection 24.1.
2.
The ﬁrst statement of Theorem 29.7 fails if λ is not assumed
antidominant. Indeed, if λ is integral but not antidominant then by
the Borel-Weil theorem (Theorem 27.3) Γ(F, Lλ) = 0, so the functor
Γ is not faithful. The second statement of Theorem 29.7 also fails if
λ ∈P and λ −ρ is not regular.
For example, for g = sl2 and λ ∈Z, the localization theorem holds
for λ ≤0. For λ ≥2 the ﬁrst statement fails but we still have an
equivalence Mλ(F) ∼= Uλ −mod (as Uλ ∼= U−λ+2), albeit not given
by Γ. But for λ = 1 there is no such equivalence at all; in fact, one
can show that the category Uλ −mod, unlike Mλ(F), has inﬁnite
cohomological dimension.

30. D-modules - II
We would now like to explain how the Beilinson-Bernstein localiza-
tion theorem can be used to classify various kinds of irreducible repre-
sentations of g. For this we will need to build up a bit more background
on D-modules.
30.1. Support of a quasicoherent sheaf. Let M be a quasicoherent
sheaf on a variety X, and Z ⊂X a closed subvariety. We will say that
M is supported on Z if for any aﬃne open set U ⊂X, regular function
f ∈O(U) vanishing on Z, and v ∈M(U), there exists N ∈Z≥0
such that f Nv = 0. The support Supp(M) is then deﬁned as the
intersection of all closed subvarietes Z ⊂X such that M is supported
on Z. So M is supported on Z iﬀthe support of M is contained in Z.
In particular, we can talk about support of a (left or right, possibly
twisted) D-module on a smooth variety X. The category of D-modules
on X supported on Z will be denoted by MZ(X).
Example 30.1. It is easy to see that C[x, x−1] is a left D-module on
A1, and C[x] is its submodule. These modules have full support A1.
On the other hand, consider the quotient δ0 := C[x, x−1]/C[x].21 It is
clear that δ0 has a basis vi = x−i, i ≥1, with xvi = vi−1, xv1 = 0,
∂vi = −ivi+1. Thus the support of δ0 is {0}.
30.2. Restriction to an open subset. Recall that if A is an abelian
category and B ⊂A a Serre subcategory (i.e., a full subcategory
closed under taking subquotients and extensions) then one can form
the quotient category A/B with the same objects as A, but with
HomA/B(X, Y ) being the direct limit of HomA(X′, Y/Y ′) over X′ ⊂X
and Y ′ ⊂Y such that X′, Y ′ ∈B. One can show that A/B is an
abelian category. The natural functor F : A →A/B is then called
the Serre quotient functor. This functor is essentially surjective, its
kernel is B, and it maps simple objects to simple objects or zero. Thus
F deﬁnes a bijection between simple objects of A not contained in B
and simple objects of A/B.
For example, if X is a variety, Z ⊂X a closed subvariety, Qcoh(X)
the category of quasicoherent sheaves on X and QcohZ(X) the full
subcategory of sheaves supported on Z then Qcoh(X)/QcohZ(X) ∼=
Qcoh(X \ Z). The corresponding Serre quotient functor is the restric-
tion M 7→M|X\Z.
21In analysis δ0 arises as the D-module generated by the δ-function at zero,
which motivates the notation.
147

[PAGE 148]
Now assume that X is smooth. Let j : X \ Z ,→X be the open
embedding. Then we have a restriction functor on D-modules
j! : M(X) →M(X \ Z)
which is the usual restriction functor at the level of sheaves; it is also
called the inverse image or pull-back functor, since it is a special
case of the inverse image functor deﬁned above. Thus j!(M) = 0 if
and only if M is supported on Z and the functor j! is a Serre quotient
functor which induces an equivalence M(X)/MZ(X) ∼= M(X \ Z).
The functor j! has a right adjoint direct image (or push-forward)
functor
j∗: M(X \ Z) →M(X),
which is just the sheaf-theoretic direct image (=push-forward). Namely,
for an aﬃne open U ⊂X, j∗M(U) := M(U \ Z) regarded as a module
over D(U) ⊂D(U \ Z). While the functor j! is exact, the functor
j∗is only left exact, in general (as so is the push-forward functor for
sheaves). In particular, j∗is not the (right exact) direct image deﬁned
above since the morphism j is not aﬃne, in general; rather it is the ze-
roth cohomology of the full direct image functor deﬁned on the derived
category of D-modules, which we will not discuss here. They do agree,
however, when j is aﬃne (e.g., when Z is a hypersurface).
In particular, j! deﬁnes a bijection between isomorphism classes of
simple DX-modules which are not supported on Z and simple DX\Z-
modules, given by M 7→j!M.
The inverse map is deﬁned as follows. Given L ∈M(X\Z), consider
the D-module j∗L. Since j∗is right adjoint to j!, the module j∗L does
not contain nonzero submodules supported on Z. Now deﬁne j!∗L to
be the intersection of all submodules N of j∗L such that j∗L/N is
supported on Z. This gives rise to a functor j!∗: M(X \ Z) →M(X)
(not left or right exact in general). Then if L is irreducible, so is j!∗L,
and j!j!∗L ∼= L, while for M ∈M(X) irreducible and not supported
on Z we have j!∗j!M ∼= M. The functor j!∗is called the Goresky-
MacPherson extension or minimal (or intermediate) extension
functor.
Proposition 30.2. The support of an irreducible D-module is irre-
ducible.
Proof. Let M be a DX-module with support Z.
Assume that Z is
reducible: Z = Z1 ∪Z2 where Z1 is an irreducible component of Z
and Z2 the union of all the other components.
Let Y = Z1 ∩Z2,
a proper subset in Z1 and Z2. Let Z◦= Z \ Y , Z◦
i = Zi \ Y and
X◦= X \ Y . Then Z◦= Z◦
1 ∪Z◦
2 is disconnected: Z◦
1, Z◦
2 are closed
148

[PAGE 149]
nonempty subsets of Z◦and Z◦
1 ∩Z◦
2 = ∅. Let M1, M2 be the sums of
all subsheaves of M|X◦which are killed by localization away from Z◦
1,
respectively Z◦
2. It is easy to show that Mi are nonzero submodules of
M|X◦and M|X◦∼= M1 ⊕M2. Thus M|X◦is reducible and hence so is
M.
□
30.3. Kashiwara’s theorem. Let X be a smooth variety and Z ⊂X
a smooth closed subvariety with closed embedding i : Z ,→X. For M ∈
M(X) deﬁne MZ to be the sheaf on X whose sections on an aﬃne open
set U ⊂X are the vectors in M(U) annihilated by regular functions on
U vanishing on Z. Thus the O(U)-action on MZ(U) factors through
O(Z ∩U). Also it is easy to see that MZ(U) depends only on Z ∩U,
i.e., it gives rise to a quasicoherent sheaf i†M on Z with sections
i†M(V ) := MZ(U)
for aﬃne open U ⊂X such that V = Z ∩U.
Moreover, if v is a
vector ﬁeld on U tangent to V then v preserves the ideal of V , hence
acts naturally on i†M(V ). Furthermore, the action of v on this space
depends only on the vector ﬁeld on V induced by v. Thus i†M(V )
carries an action of the Lie algebra Vect(V ). Together with the action
of O(V ), this deﬁnes an action of D(V ) on i†M(V ).
We conclude
that i†M is naturally a DZ-module. Thus we have deﬁned a left exact
functor
i† : M(X) →M(Z).
It is called the shifted inverse image functor. This terminology is
motivated by the following exercise.
Exercise 30.3. Show that i† = Ldi! and i! = Rdi†, where Ld, Rd are the
d-th left, respectively right derived functors and d = dim X −dim Z.
Theorem 30.4. (Kashiwara) The functor i† is an equivalence of cat-
egories MZ(X) →M(Z).
The proof is not diﬃcult, but we will skip it (see [HTT]).
The inverse of the functor i† is called the direct image functor and
denoted i∗: M(Z) →MZ(X), as it is a special case of the direct
image functor deﬁned above for aﬃne morphisms. If we view i∗as a
functor M(Z) →M(X) then it has both left and right adjoint, where
are i! and i†, respectively.
Let us give a prototypical example.
Example 30.5. Let X = A1, Z = {0}. Then M(Z) = Vect and
i∗(V ) = V ⊗δ0. So in this case Kashiwara’s theorem reduces to the
claim that Ext1(δ0, δ0) = 0.
149

[PAGE 150]
Remark 30.6. We note that the above formalism and results extend
in a straightforward manner to the case of twisted D-modules.
30.4. Equivariant D-modules. Let X be an algebraic variety with
an action of an aﬃne algebraic group G. Let us review the notion of a
G-equivariant quasicoherent sheaf on X. Roughly speaking, this is
a quasicoherent sheaf E on X equipped with a system of isomorphisms
φg : g(E) ∼= E, g ∈G such that φgh = φg ◦g(φh) and φg depends on g
algebraically. To give a formal deﬁnition, note that the group structure
gives us a multiplication map m : G × G ↠G, and the action of G
gives us a map ρ : G × X ↠X. We have a commutative diagram
G × G × X
m×id
w
id ×ρ
'
G × X
ρ
'
G × X
ρ
w
X
.
Deﬁnition 30.7. A G-equivariant quasicoherent sheaf on X is a
quasicoherent sheaf E on X equipped with an isomorphism
φ : ρ∗E ∼= OG ⊠E
making the following diagram commutative:
(id ×ρ)∗ρ∗E
(id ×ρ)∗φ
/ (id ×ρ)∗(OG ⊠E)
/ OG ⊠ρ∗E
OG⊠φ

(m × id)∗ρ∗E
(m×id)∗φ
/ (m × id)∗(OG ⊠E)
/ OG ⊠OG ⊠E
Thus φ comprises all the isomorphisms φg, which therefore satisfy
the equality φgh = φg ◦g(φh) and depend on g algebraically.
We now wish to deﬁne the notion of a G-equivariant DX-module.
To this end, recall that for any DX-module E, the quasicoherent sheaf
ρ∗E carries a natural structure of a DG×X-module (the D-module in-
verse image). We now make the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 30.8. A weakly G-equivariant D-module on X is a DX-
module E with a G-equivariant quasicoherent sheaf structure, where φ
is DX-linear.
Note that if E is a weakly equivariant DX-module then we have two
(in general, diﬀerent) actions of g = Lie(G) on E. First of all, the
G-action on X gives us maps g →Vect(X) →D(X), and so the D-
module structure on E gives us a g-action x 7→b0(x) on E. Note that
150

[PAGE 151]
this action does not depend on the choice of the weakly equivariant
structure φ.
On the other hand, we have a g-action on OG ⊠E coming from the
G-action on G × X given by g · (h, x) = (gh, x). Translating this along
φ, we get a g-action on ρ∗E. Restricting to 1×X, this gives us another
g-action x 7→bφ(x) on E.
Deﬁnition 30.9. A (strongly) G-equivariant DX-module is a weakly
G-equivariant DX-module where these two g-actions agree: bφ = b0 (or,
equivalently, where φ is DG×X-linear.)
In general, since [b0(x), L] = [bφ(x), L] for L ∈DX, the operator
ρφ(x) := bφ(x)−b0(x) is a D-module endomorphism of E. Moreover, it
is easy to see that ρφ is a Lie algebra homomorphism g →End(E). In
particular, if E is irreducible then by Dixmier’s lemma (Lemma 7.2),
End(E) = C, so ρφ is just a character of g. Thus if g = [g, g] is perfect
(for example, semisimple) then every weakly G-equivariant irreducible
DX-module is actually (strongly) G-equivariant.
Remark 30.10. A given DX-module may have many weakly G-equivariant
structures, but if G is connected, then it can only have one G-equivariant
structure.
This is because the g-action on E is determined by the
map g →D(X) and this action can be integrated to a G-equivariant
structure in an unique way (recall that we always work over a ﬁeld of
characteristic 0.)
Furthermore, any DX-linear map of G-equivariant DX-modules is
automatically compatible with the G-action. This is because such a
map is necessarily g-linear, which implies that it is in fact G-linear.
These two facts combined show that the category of G-equivariant DX-
modules is a full subcategory of the category of DX-modules. Stated
another way, G-equivariance of a DX-module is a property, not a struc-
ture.
Example 30.11. Consider the case where X is a point. Then DX ∼= C
and so a DX-module is a just a vector space. A weakly G-equivariant
DX-module is then simply a locally algebraic representation of G. This
representation gives a G-equivariant structure if and only if g acts by
0, i.e., the connected component of the identity G0 ⊂G acts trivially.
Thus a G-equivariant DX-module is just a representation of the com-
ponent group G/G0. Conversely, any locally algebraic representation
V of G gives rise to a weakly G-equivariant D-module on X which is
equivariant iﬀG0 acts trivially on V , so that V is a representation of
G/G0.
151

[PAGE 152]
Example 30.12. Let X = G/H, where G is an algebraic group and
H a closed subgroup of G. Then we claim that a G-equivariant DX-
module is the same thing as an H-equivariant D-module on a point,
i.e., a representation of the component group H/H0. Indeed, given an
H/H0-module V , we can deﬁne a G-equivariant vector bundle
(G × V )/H →X = G/H,
where H acts on G × V via (g, v)h = (gh, h−1v). Note that this can
be written as (G/H0)×V
H/H0
(as H0 acts on V trivially). This shows that
this vector bundle has a natural ﬂat connection, i.e. is a DX-module
L(X, V ), which is clearly G-equivariant. The assignment V 7→L(X, V )
is the desired equivalence. In the case H = G, this reduces to Example
30.11.
Exercise 30.13. (i) Deﬁne the algebraic group L := G ×G/G0 H/H0
of pairs (g, h), g ∈G, h ∈H/H0 which map to the same element of
G/G0; thus we have a short exact sequence
1 →G0 →L →H/H0 →1.
Show that the category of weakly G-equivariant D-modules on G/H is
naturally equivalent to the category of representations of L, such that
the subcategory of strongly G-equivariant D-modules is identiﬁed with
the subcategory of representations of L pulled back from the second
factor H/H0 (i.e., those with trivial action of G0), and the subcategory
of modules of the form O(G/H)⊗V where V is a G-module is identiﬁed
with the category of representations of L pulled back from the ﬁrst
factor G.
(ii) Let ∆: H →L be the map deﬁned by ∆(h) = (h, h). Show
that the forgetful functor from weakly G-equivariant D-modules on
G/H to G-equivariant quasicoherent sheaves on G/H corresponds to
the pullback functor ∆∗.
Exercise 30.14. Let X be a smooth variety with an action of an aﬃne
algebraic group G and H ⊂G be a closed subgroup. Show that the
category of H-equivariant D-modules on X is naturally equivalent to
the category of G-equivariant D-modules on X × G/H with diagonal
action of G (note that when X is a point, this reduces to Example
30.12).
Exercise 30.15. Let X be a principal G-bundle over a smooth vari-
ety Y . Show that the category of G-equivariant DX-modules is nat-
urally equivalent to the category of DY -modules. Namely, given a G-
equivariant DX-module M, for an aﬃne open set U ⊂Y let eU be the
152

[PAGE 153]
preimage of U in X and let M(U) := M(eU)G. Then M is a DY -module,
and the assignment M 7→M is a desired equivalence.
The notion of a weakly equivariant D-module often arises in the
following setting. Let T be an algebraic torus and let e
X be a principal
T-bundle over X.
Deﬁnition 30.16. A monodromic DX-module (with respect to the
bundle e
X ↠X) is a weakly T-equivariant D e
X-module.
Example 30.17. A monodromic DX-module with ρφ = λ ∈Lie(T)∗
is the same thing as a λ-twisted D-module on X, i.e., a Dλ,X-module.
Proposition 30.18. Assume that X is a D-aﬃne variety and that
K is an aﬃne algebraic group acting on X. Let D(X) be the ring of
global sections of DX. Then the category of K-equivariant DX-modules
is equivalent to the category of D(X)-modules M endowed with a locally
ﬁnite K-action whose diﬀerential coincides with the action of Lie(K)
on M coming from the map Lie(K) →D(X).
Exercise 30.19. Prove Proposition 30.18.
In particular, by the Beilinson-Bernstein localization theorem, Propo-
sition 30.18 applies to X = F ∼= G/B and K a closed subgroup of G,
and moreover it extends to the case of λ-twisted diﬀerential operators
on F for antidominant λ ∈h∗. Thus we get
Corollary 30.20. If λ ∈h∗is antidominant then the functors Γ, Loc
restrict to mutually inverse equivalences between the category of (g, K)-
modules with inﬁnitesimal character χλ−ρ and the category of K-equivariant
Dλ-modules on F.

31. Applications of D-modules to representation theory
31.1. Classiﬁcation of irreducible equivariant D-modules for
actions with ﬁnitely many orbits.
Theorem 31.1. Let X be a smooth variety and K a connected algebraic
group acting on X with ﬁnitely many orbits. Then there are ﬁnitely
many irreducible K-equivariant D-modules on X. Namely, they are
parametrized by pairs (O, V ) where O is an orbit of K on X and V
is an irreducible representation of the component group H/H0 of the
stabilizer H := Kx for x ∈O, (O, V ) 7→M(O, V ).
Proof. Let M be an irreducible K-equivariant D-module on X. Then
by Proposition 30.2, the support Z of M is irreducible. Thus Z = O
for a single orbit O of K. Let Z0 = O\O, and U = X \Z0. Then U is a
K-stable open subset of X and O is closed in U. Also M|U is a simple
DU-module supported on O. Let i : O ,→X be the closed embedding.
By Kashiwara’s theorem (Theorem 30.4) i†M is a simple K-equivariant
D-module on O. Thus by Example 30.12 i†M = L(O, V ) for some
irreducible representation V of the component group of the stabilizer
Kx, x ∈O. Also it is clear that L(O, V ) gives rise to a simple K-
equivariant D-module on X, namely, M(O, V ) := j!∗i∗M(O, V ), where
j : U ,→X is the open embedding. This proves the theorem.
□
Remark 31.2. Theorem 31.1 can be extended in a straightforward
way to weakly equivariant D-modules.
In this case, recall that the
weakly equivariant structure on an irreducible D-module M deﬁnes a
character ρ : k →C, where k = LieK. Theorem 31.1 then holds with
the only change: rather than being a representation of H/H0, V now
needs to be a representation of H in which Lie(H) acts by the character
ρ. The proof is analogous to the case ρ = 0.
In particular, this applies to the case of twisted D-modules. In this
case we have a principal T-bundle p : e
X →X and a character λ ∈t∗,
t = Lie(T). Suppose K acts on X preserving this bundle; i.e., it acts
on e
X and commutes with T. So we have a K × T-action on e
X and
a K-equivariant λ-twisted D-module on X is just a weakly K × T-
equivariant D-module on e
X with ρ(k, t) := λ(t). Now, for every K-
orbit O on X, we have the stabilizer Kx, x ∈O, and a homomorphism
ξx : Kx →T deﬁned by the condition that (g, ξx(g)) acts trivially on
p−1(x) for g ∈Kx. This deﬁnes a character λx = λ ◦dξx of Lie(Kx),
and the simple K-equivariant Dλ-modules on X are M(O, V ) where
V is an irreducible representation of Kx with Lie(Kx) acting by the
character λx.

31.2. Classiﬁcation of irreducible Harish-Chandra modules. Let
GR be a connected real semisimple algebraic group, KR ⊂GR a max-
imal compact subgroup, G, K ⊂G their complexiﬁcations. By Corol-
lary 30.20, if λ is antidominant then the Beilinson-Bernstein equiva-
lence restricts to an equivalence between the category of (g, K)-modules
with inﬁnitesimal character χλ−ρ and the category of K-equivariant
Dλ-modules on F = G/B.
Proposition 31.3. The group K acts on F with ﬁnitely many orbits.
We will not give a proof of this proposition.
For the proof and
description of the set of orbits, see [RS].
Proposition 31.3 along with Theorem 31.1 allows us to classify ir-
reducible (g, K)-modules (i.e., Harish-Chandra modules) for a regular
inﬁnitesimal character (the general case can be handled similarly).
Namely, let H ⊂B ⊂G be a maximal torus and Borel subgroup of
G; so H ∼= B/[B, B]. Note that K × H acts on eF = G/[B, B]. So
for a K-orbit O on F = G/B and x ∈O, we have a homomorphism
ξx : Kx →H such that (g, ξx(g)) acts trivially on the ﬁber over x in eF
for g ∈Kx.
Let χ be a regular inﬁnitesimal character for g and λ be an antidom-
inant weight with χ = χλ−ρ (note that it always exists).
Theorem 31.4. Irreducible (g, K)-modules with (pure) inﬁnitesimal
character χ are π(O, V ) where O is a K-orbit on F and V an irre-
ducible representation of Kx, x ∈O such that Lie(Kx) acts via the
character λx.
Namely, π(O, V ) corresponds to M(O, V ) under the
Beilinson-Bernstein equivalence.
Example 31.5. Let GR = SL2(R).
Let λ ∈C, λ /∈Z>0 and set
χ = χλ−1 (so χ ̸= χ0). In this case F = CP1 is the Riemann sphere,
and K = C× acts by k◦z := k2z. Thus we have three orbits: 0, ∞, and
C×. For the orbit C× we have Kx = Z/2, so we have two irreducible
representations V = C±, which generically correspond to principal se-
ries representations π(C×, V±) = P±(1 −λ) (see Section 9). The other
two orbits have a connected stabilizer, and λx = ±λ. Thus for such
orbits representations exist only for λ ∈Z≤0. It is easy to see that
these are exactly the discrete series representations M +
λ−2, M −
−λ+2. Also
for such points one of the principal series representations is reducible
(P+(1 −λ) for even λ and P−(1 −λ) for odd λ) and π(C×, V+), respec-
tively π(C×, V−) is actually the ﬁnite-dimensional representation L−λ.
Thus we have four irreducible representations in this case.
155

[PAGE 156]
Note that this agrees with our classiﬁcation of irreducible representa-
tions of SL2(R) for regular inﬁnitesimal characters discussed in Section
9.
Example 31.6. Let G be a simply connected complex semisimple
group regarded as a real group. Then its maximal compact subgroup
is Gc, so its complexiﬁcation is G, and GC = G × G, so that the in-
clusion (Gc)C = G ,→GC = G × G is the diagonal embedding. The
ﬂag variety is F × F = G/B × G/B. Thus Harish-Chandra bimod-
ules with inﬁnitesimal character (χµ−ρ, χλ−ρ) for antidominant λ, µ are
π(O, V ) where O runs over orbits of G on G/B × G/B and V over
appropriate representations of isotropy groups. Note that orbits of G
on G/B × G/B are in a natural bijection with orbits of B on G/B,
which are the Schubert cells Cw labeled by w ∈W. One can check
that the condition for existence of V on the orbit Cw is that λ −wµ is
integral, and then V is unique (as the isotropy groups are connected in
this case). Thus we ﬁnd that the irreducible Harish-Chandra bimod-
ules with such inﬁnitesimal character are labeled by elements w such
that λ −wµ ∈P, which agrees with the classiﬁcation we obtained in
Subsection 25.2.
Exercise 31.7. Classify irreducible Harish-Chandra modules for SL3(R)
with a regular inﬁnitesimal character.
Hint. Classify orbits of SO3(C) on SL3(C)/B. This is equivalent to
classiﬁcation of ﬂags in a 3-dimensional complex inner product space
E under the action of SO(E). Then classify possible representations
V of the isotropy group for each orbit.
Remark 31.8. The K-orbits on G/B can be classiﬁed in explicit com-
binatorial terms. Together with Theorem 31.4, this leads to an alterna-
tive proof, using the localization theorem, of the Langlands classiﬁ-
cation of irreducible Harish-Chandra modules (obtained by Langlands
in 1973 by a diﬀerent method, 8 years before the localization theorem
was proved, [La]). This classiﬁcation requires a serious separate dis-
cussion which is beyond the scope of these notes.
31.3. Applications to category O. Let us now see how this ap-
proach allows us to study category O for a semisimple Lie algebra g.
Consider the category C of weakly B × B-equivariant ﬁnitely gener-
ated D-modules on G which are equivariant under [B, B] × [B, B] (it
is easy to see that such modules have ﬁnite length). Thus for M ∈C,
we have a homomorphism ρ : h ⊕h →End(M), so M = ⊕µ,λM(µ, λ)
where M(µ, λ) is the generalized eigenspace for h ⊕h with eigenvalue
(µ, λ) ∈h∗× h∗. Thus we have a decomposition C = ⊕µ,λCµ,λ.
156

[PAGE 157]
Let C[µ],λ, Cµ,[λ], C[µ],[λ] be the full subcategories of Cµ,λ consisting of
objects on which the eigenvalues in square brackets are pure (without
Jordan blocks). Thus we have
Cµ,λ ⊃C[µ],λ, Cµ,[λ] ⊃C[µ],[λ]
and all simple objects of Cµ,λ are contained in C[µ],[λ]. These objects
are labeled by Bruhat cells BwB ⊂G, w ∈W and representations V
of the isotropy group satisfying an appropriate condition. As before,
the condition for V to exist is that λ −wµ ∈P, thus Cµ,λ = 0 unless
λ −wµ ∈P for some w ∈W.
We also see that Cλ,µ ∼= Cλ+β,µ+γ for β, γ ∈P, and the same applies
to its subcategories.
Let us now try to describe these categories representation-theoretically.
To this end, note that we may interpret C[µ],[λ] as the category of weakly
B-equivariant Dλ-modules on G/B with (pure) equivariance character
µ. So if λ is antidominant, we get that C[µ],[λ] is equivalent to the full
subcategory O[µ],[λ] of the category Oχλ−ρ of objects with pure inﬁni-
tesimal character χλ−ρ and weights in µ+P. Similarly, Cµ,λ, C[µ],λ, Cµ,[λ]
are equivalent to Oµ,λ, O[µ],λ, Oµ,[λ], where the corresponding (inﬁnites-
imal) character is pure if square brackets are present and generalized
if not.
Now note that ﬂipping left and right, we get equivalences Cλ,µ ∼= Cµ,λ,
C[λ],µ ∼= Cµ,[λ] Cλ,[µ] ∼= C[µ],λ C[λ],[µ] ∼= C[µ],[λ]. If λ, µ are both antidomi-
nant, this yields equivalences of representation categories Oλ,µ ∼= Oµ,λ,
O[λ],µ ∼= Oµ,[λ] Oλ,[µ] ∼= O[µ],λ O[λ],[µ] ∼= O[µ],[λ]. While the ﬁrst equiva-
lence is easy to see representation theoretically using translation func-
tors, the others are not. They are clear from geometry but somewhat
mysterious from the viewpoint of representation theory (although they
can be understood using the Bernstein-Gelfand equivalence between
category O and the category of Harish-Chandra bimodules, Theorem
25.8).
Example 31.9. If λ, µ ∈P, these categories are independent of λ, µ.
Namely, let O0 be the category O for the trivial generalized inﬁnites-
imal character, and e
O0 be its Serre closure (the category of modules
admitting a ﬁnite ﬁltration whose successive quotients are in O0; i.e.
the action of h is not necessarily diagonalizable but is only assumed
locally ﬁnite). We may also deﬁne the category O∗
0 of modules in e
O0
which have pure inﬁnitesimal character, and O0 ⊂O0 of modules with
both pure inﬁnitesimal character and diagonalizable action of h. Then
the above four categories are exactly e
O0, O0, O∗
0, O0. In particular, we
157

[PAGE 158]
obtain an equivalence O0 ∼= O∗
0 which is not obvious representation-
theoretically.
Finally, we note that Exercise 30.14 applied to X = G/B and H = B
gives a transparent geometric proof of Theorem 25.8.
